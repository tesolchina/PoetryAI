- **Secondary Objectives**:
  - Describe and compare learner inquiry moves across parameter settings
  - Examine collaborative dynamics and scaffolding patterns
  - Rank interaction types by instructional usefulness

### 1.4 Research Questions
1. **RQ1**: How do parameter settings condition learners' inquiry moves and appeals to exemplars during poem co-creation?
2. **RQ2**: What forms of teacher/peer scaffolding emerge, and how do learners take up this scaffolding across parameter conditions?
3. **RQ3**: How do collaborative dynamics unfold and vary by parameter settings?
4. **RQ4**: Which interaction types are most useful for instruction based on frequency, sequencing, and impact?

### 1.5 Significance & Contributions
- **Theoretical**: Bridge between technical AI research and educational applications
- **Practical**: Evidence-based guidance for AI-assisted creative writing instruction
- **Methodological**: Framework for studying human-AI creative collaboration
- **Pedagogical**: Process-oriented approach to AI literacy in creative contexts
