# Ruobin's Research Project

**Title**: What Is the "Temperature" of a Poem? Classroom Interactions in L2 Poetry Writing with LLMs as Co-creation Partners

**Student**: Yu Ruobin  
**Department**: English, Academy of Language and Culture  
**Faculty**: Arts and Social Sciences, Hong Kong Baptist University

## Project Overview

This study investigates how English L2 undergraduates co-create poems with LLM models while manipulating parameters such as temperature and top p to shape output variability. The research aims to provide a process-oriented account of human-AI interaction in L2 creative writing contexts.

## Key Research Questions

1. How do parameter settings (low vs. high temperature/top p) condition learners' inquiry moves and appeals to exemplars during poem co-creation?

2. What forms of teacher/peer scaffolding emerge, and how do learners take up this scaffolding across parameter conditions?

3. How do collaborative dynamics (evaluation, negotiation, co-creation) unfold and vary by parameter settings?

4. Which interaction types are most useful for instruction, as indicated by their frequency, sequencing centrality, and impact on revision and metalinguistic talk?
