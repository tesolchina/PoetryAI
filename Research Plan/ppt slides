## Slide 1: Chatbot Design

### What Is the "Temperature" of a Poem? 
**AI-Assisted L2 Poetry Writing with Parameter Manipulation**

#### Chatbot Architecture
- **Two Experimental Conditions:**
  - **Room A (Constrained)**: Temperature 0.1-0.2, Top-p 0.1-0.2
  - **Room B (Exploratory)**: Temperature 0.8-0.9, Top-p 0.8-0.9

#### Chatbot Features
- **Supportive English L2 Poetry Coach**
- **Six Interactive Modes:**
  - Warm-up: sensory word pools, image sparks
  - Analyze exemplar: explain poetic devices
  - Form practice: haiku, couplet, quatrain
  - Draft with constraints: guided composition
  - Surprise generator: divergent ideas and metaphors
  - Revision coach: targeted improvement suggestions

#### Parameter Awareness Manipulation
- **Aware UI**: Shows temperature/top-p settings to participants
- **Unaware UI**: No mention of parameter settings
- **Pedagogical Focus**: One device per turn, student voice central

## Slide 2: Research Layout

### Mixed-Methods Experimental Design

#### Participants & Setting
- **20 English L2 undergraduates** (B1+ CEFR proficiency)
- **Creative writing course** at Hong Kong Baptist University
- **Balanced distribution**: 10 participants per room (A/B)
- **Random assignment**: Aware vs. Unaware parameter conditions

#### Data Collection Protocol
1. **Pre-experiment**: Consent, orientation, baseline survey
2. **Chatbot Interaction** (15 min): Draft 4-6 lines with AI partner
3. **Guided Reflection** (10 min): Parameter perception, learning experience
4. **Debate Session** (20 min): "Are LLM-assisted results good poetry?"

#### Three-Type Interaction Framework
- **Type A**: Diagnosis → Repair (form/constraint fixes)
- **Type B**: Exemplar Pivot (anchor with examples → apply characteristics)
- **Type C**: Surprise Harvest (seek divergent ideas → selective integration)

#### Data Sources
- Chat logs and API tracking
- Audio recordings of debates
- Poem artifacts and revisions
- Pre/post surveys and reflections

## Slide 3: Anticipation and Hypotheses

### Pre-Experimental Hypotheses

#### Hypothesis A1: Constraint Repair (Type A)
**Prediction**: Low-variability settings (Room A) will generate more frequent and earlier Type A moves
- **Expected Evidence**: Higher frequency of form-focused repairs
- **Outcome**: Better cohesion/clarity ratings, shorter time-to-fix

#### Hypothesis B1: Exemplar Anchoring (Type B)
**Prediction**: High-variability settings (Room B) will increase Type B usage to control drift
- **Expected Evidence**: More exemplar requests after surprising outputs
- **Outcome**: Improved coherence through strategic anchoring

#### Hypothesis C1: Creative Exploration (Type C)
**Prediction**: High-variability settings will produce more Surprise Harvest moves
- **Expected Evidence**: More C→A sequences (creative exploration + repair)
- **Outcome**: Higher originality scores with subsequent form corrections

### Parameter Awareness Effects
- **Aware participants**: Strategic use of interaction types based on parameter knowledge
- **Unaware participants**: Intuitive responses without explicit parameter attribution

### Expected Contributions
1. **Process account** of human-AI interaction in L2 creative writing
2. **Practical ranking** of interaction types for classroom implementation
3. **Open tutorial and API framework** for educators
4. **Guidelines** for integrating generative AI in corpus-based learning
