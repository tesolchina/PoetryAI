### Section C. Research Protocol and Documentation

#### **Summary of the Research**

This study investigates how English L2 undergraduates co-create poems with a Large Language Model (LLM) while manipulating parameters such as temperature and top-p to shape output variability. The research aims to understand classroom interactions in L2 poetry writing with AI as co-creation partners, specifically examining how parameter settings condition learners' inquiry moves, scaffolding dynamics, and collaborative creativity patterns. 

Students in a university creative writing course will complete scaffolding tasks drafting, critiquing, and redrafting poems with a customized chatbot under contrasting parameter settings (low vs. high temperature/top-p). The study will take place at Hong Kong Baptist University in classroom 0EE702, Old Campus, during regularly scheduled class time.
