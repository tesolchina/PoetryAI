## ðŸŽ¯ Core Research Questions Addressed

1. **RQ1**: How do parameter settings condition learners' inquiry moves and appeals to exemplars?
2. **RQ2**: What forms of scaffolding emerge across parameter conditions?
3. **RQ3**: How do collaborative dynamics unfold and vary by parameter settings?
4. **RQ4**: Which interaction types are most useful for instruction?

## ðŸ“Š Three Interaction Types Framework

- **Type A (Diagnosis â†’ Repair)**: Form/constraint fixes
- **Type B (Exemplar Pivot)**: Anchor â†’ apply characteristics  
- **Type C (Surprise Harvest)**: Divergent â†’ selective uptake
