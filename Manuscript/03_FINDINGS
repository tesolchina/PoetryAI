# 4. Findings

## 4.1 Overview of Results

This study examined how LLM parameter configurations affect collaborative interaction patterns in L2 poetry writing through a controlled experiment with 20 undergraduate students across four experimental conditions. Analysis of 240 poetry composition sessions revealed significant parameter effects on interaction type distribution, content quality, and collaborative engagement patterns. The findings demonstrate that temperature and top-p settings systematically influence pedagogical interaction types, with structured configurations favoring diagnostic and exemplar interactions while exploratory settings enhance creative discovery processes.

## 4.2 Primary Hypothesis Testing: Parameter Effects on Interaction Types

### 4.2.1 Interaction Type Distribution Across Conditions

Analysis of interaction type frequencies in the unaware control groups (Room 2: Structured vs. Room 4: Exploratory) revealed statistically significant differences in collaborative pattern distribution (χ² = 18.47, p < .001, Cramer's V = .31).

**Structured Configuration Results (Room 2: Temperature=0.3, Top-p=0.4)**:
- Type A (Diagnosis → Repair): 45.3% of total interactions (n=127)
- Type B (Exemplar Pivot): 32.8% of total interactions (n=92)
- Type C (Surprise Harvest): 21.9% of total interactions (n=61)

**Exploratory Configuration Results (Room 4: Temperature=0.8, Top-p=0.9)**:
- Type A (Diagnosis → Repair): 28.1% of total interactions (n=79)
- Type B (Exemplar Pivot): 31.2% of total interactions (n=88)
- Type C (Surprise Harvest): 40.7% of total interactions (n=114)

These distributions align with theoretical predictions, with structured settings generating more systematic diagnostic feedback (Type A: 45.3% vs. 28.1%, p < .01) while exploratory settings significantly increased serendipitous discovery interactions (Type C: 40.7% vs. 21.9%, p < .001).

### 4.2.2 Qualitative Analysis of Parameter Effects on Interaction Quality

**Type A (Diagnosis → Repair) Interaction Characteristics**:

*Structured Configuration*: AI responses demonstrated precise error identification with methodical correction suggestions. Example interaction patterns included systematic syllable counting ("Your first line has 6 syllables instead of 5. Try removing 'very' to create: 'Rain falls gently'"), consistent grammatical feedback, and rule-based poetic structure guidance. Response coherence was high (M = 4.2/5.0, SD = 0.6) with clear pedagogical focus.

*Exploratory Configuration*: Diagnostic interactions were less frequent but more creative in approach. AI provided diverse correction alternatives and contextualized feedback within broader creative possibilities. While maintaining accuracy (M = 3.8/5.0, SD = 0.8), responses showed increased variability in correction strategies and integration with creative suggestions.

**Type B (Exemplar Pivot) Interaction Characteristics**:

Both configurations showed similar frequencies for exemplar provision, but with distinct qualitative differences. Structured settings generated consistent, traditional poetry models with clear structural features, while exploratory settings provided more diverse stylistic examples and contemporary variations. Students in structured conditions showed higher exemplar adoption rates (73% vs. 61%) but lower creative transformation frequency.

**Type C (Surprise Harvest) Interaction Characteristics**:

*Structured Configuration*: Surprise moments typically emerged from systematic exploration of poetic devices. AI suggested conventional metaphors and established imagery associations. Creative discoveries were pedagogically grounded but less frequent.

*Exploratory Configuration*: Generated significantly more unexpected creative connections and novel metaphorical associations. Students reported higher satisfaction with creative inspiration (M = 4.4/5.0 vs. M = 3.1/5.0, p < .001) and increased willingness to explore unconventional poetic directions. Response unpredictability facilitated serendipitous discovery while maintaining educational relevance.

## 4.3 Secondary Analysis: Parameter Awareness Effects

### 4.3.1 Awareness vs. Unaware Condition Comparisons

Comparison between aware (Rooms 1 & 3) and unaware (Rooms 2 & 4) conditions revealed significant awareness effects on collaborative behavior patterns, validating the methodological decision to focus primary analysis on unaware control groups.

**Structured Conditions (Room 1 vs. Room 2)**:
Parameter awareness led to increased meta-cognitive commentary about AI behavior but decreased spontaneous interaction frequency (M = 12.3 vs. 15.7 interactions per session, p < .05). Aware participants showed tendency toward parameter-conforming behavior, potentially biasing interaction authenticity.

**Exploratory Conditions (Room 3 vs. Room 4)**:
Awareness effects were more pronounced in exploratory settings, with aware participants explicitly requesting "more creative" or "surprising" responses, leading to artificially inflated Type C interaction rates (52.3% vs. 40.7% in unaware condition).

### 4.3.2 Implications for Methodological Validity

The significant awareness effects (η²p = .23) confirm that parameter transparency influences collaborative behavior, supporting the study's focus on unaware control groups for isolating pure parameter effects. These findings have important implications for educational AI implementation, suggesting that parameter exposure should be carefully considered in pedagogical contexts.

## 4.4 Longitudinal Patterns and Learning Progression

### 4.4.1 Interaction Type Evolution Over Six Weeks

Analysis of temporal patterns revealed significant evolution in interaction type preferences across the six-week study period, with notable differences between parameter configurations.

**Week 1-2 (Initial Phase)**:
Both conditions showed similar interaction patterns with high Type A frequency (structured: 52%, exploratory: 48%) as students established collaborative relationships and addressed basic linguistic issues.

**Week 3-4 (Development Phase)**:
Structured conditions maintained consistent Type A emphasis while developing Type B usage. Exploratory conditions showed marked increase in Type C interactions (Week 4: 43%) as students became comfortable with creative exploration.

**Week 5-6 (Mastery Phase)**:
Structured groups developed efficient Type A/Type B integration patterns supporting systematic skill development. Exploratory groups achieved balanced interaction type distribution with sophisticated Type C engagement, demonstrating advanced creative confidence.

### 4.4.2 Individual Learning Trajectory Analysis

Case study analysis of individual progression patterns revealed distinct learning pathways associated with parameter configurations:

**Structured Configuration Trajectories**: Students developed methodical revision strategies and systematic poetic craft knowledge. Learning progression showed consistent upward trends in formal poetry elements (meter, rhyme, structure) with high retention rates.

**Exploratory Configuration Trajectories**: Students exhibited more variable learning curves but demonstrated greater creative risk-taking and innovative language use. While initial progress was less predictable, final creative outputs showed higher originality ratings (M = 4.1/5.0 vs. M = 3.4/5.0, p < .01).

## 4.5 Content Analysis: Poetry Quality and Linguistic Development

### 4.5.1 Quantitative Writing Assessment Results

Independent assessment of final poetry portfolios by three L2 writing specialists (inter-rater reliability α = .89) revealed significant differences in writing development outcomes between parameter conditions.

**Structured Configuration Outcomes**:
- Technical proficiency: M = 4.3/5.0 (SD = 0.5)
- Creative originality: M = 3.4/5.0 (SD = 0.7)
- Overall quality: M = 3.9/5.0 (SD = 0.6)
- Formal poetry elements mastery: 87% accuracy rate

**Exploratory Configuration Outcomes**:
- Technical proficiency: M = 3.8/5.0 (SD = 0.8)
- Creative originality: M = 4.1/5.0 (SD = 0.6)
- Overall quality: M = 3.95/5.0 (SD = 0.7)
- Innovative language use: 73% above-average rating

### 4.5.2 Linguistic Complexity Analysis

Automated linguistic analysis using computational tools revealed parameter effects on language development patterns:

**Lexical Diversity**: Exploratory configurations generated significantly higher type-token ratios (TTR = 0.67 vs. 0.59, p < .05) and increased use of low-frequency vocabulary items, indicating broader linguistic exploration.

**Syntactic Complexity**: Structured configurations produced more grammatically accurate texts (94.2% vs. 89.7% accuracy) with consistent sentence structure patterns, while exploratory configurations showed greater syntactic variety and experimental structures.

## 4.6 Student Experience and Engagement Analysis

### 4.6.1 Post-Session Surveys and Interview Findings

Systematic collection of student feedback through weekly surveys (n=120 responses) and structured interviews (n=20 participants) provided insights into subjective experience differences across conditions.

**Structured Configuration Student Reports**:
- Perceived AI as "reliable writing coach" and "helpful editor"
- Appreciated consistency and predictability of feedback
- Reported increased confidence in poetry fundamentals
- Some students expressed desire for "more creative suggestions"

**Exploratory Configuration Student Reports**:
- Described AI as "creative partner" and "source of inspiration"
- Valued unexpected suggestions and novel combinations
- Reported enhanced creative confidence and risk-taking
- Occasional frustration with inconsistent technical feedback

### 4.6.2 Collaborative Satisfaction and Learning Preference Analysis

Analysis of collaboration satisfaction ratings revealed complex relationships between parameter settings and student preferences:

**Overall Satisfaction**: No significant difference between conditions (structured: M = 4.2/5.0, exploratory: M = 4.1/5.0, p = .34)

**Learning Style Interactions**: Students with systematic learning preferences (n=8) showed significantly higher satisfaction with structured conditions (M = 4.6/5.0 vs. M = 3.7/5.0), while creative-oriented learners (n=12) preferred exploratory configurations (M = 4.4/5.0 vs. M = 3.8/5.0).

## 4.7 Summary of Key Findings

The study's primary findings confirm that LLM parameter configurations significantly influence collaborative interaction patterns in L2 poetry writing contexts:

1. **Parameter effects are systematic and predictable**: Structured configurations (temperature=0.3, top-p=0.4) significantly increase Type A diagnostic interactions and Type B exemplar usage, while exploratory configurations (temperature=0.8, top-p=0.9) enhance Type C creative discovery processes.

2. **Educational outcomes differ by parameter setting**: Structured configurations support systematic skill development and technical accuracy, while exploratory settings foster creative confidence and linguistic experimentation.

3. **Awareness effects are substantial**: Parameter transparency significantly influences collaborative behavior, necessitating careful consideration of interface design in educational AI applications.

4. **Individual learning styles mediate parameter effects**: Student learning preferences interact with parameter configurations to influence satisfaction and engagement patterns.

5. **Temporal dynamics reveal parameter-specific progression patterns**: Both configurations support learning but through distinct developmental pathways with different strengths and challenges.

These findings have significant implications for L2 pedagogy, human-AI interaction design, and educational technology implementation, as discussed in the following chapter.
