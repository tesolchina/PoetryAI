# 3. Methodology

## 3.1 Research Design

This study employed a 2×2 factorial experimental design to investigate how LLM parameter configurations affect collaborative interaction patterns in L2 poetry writing. Two independent variables were systematically manipulated: AI parameter configuration (Structured: temperature=0.3, top-p=0.4 vs. Exploratory: temperature=0.8, top-p=0.9) and parameter awareness condition (Aware vs. Unaware interface). This design enabled examination of pure parameter effects while controlling for potential awareness bias in educational contexts.

The investigation was conducted over six weeks with 20 English L2 undergraduate students enrolled in a creative writing poetry course at Hong Kong Baptist University. The primary analysis focused on unaware control groups (Room 2 vs. Room 4) to isolate parameter effects from awareness bias, while secondary analyses examined awareness conditions for methodological validation.

## 3.2 Theoretical Framework

The study operationalizes human-AI collaboration through three interaction types derived from established L2 pedagogy and creative collaboration research:

**Type A (Diagnosis → Repair)** conceptualizes AI as a diagnostic feedback provider, aligned with Lyster and Ranta's (1997) corrective feedback taxonomy. In this interaction mode, AI identifies structural, linguistic, or poetic issues and provides targeted suggestions for improvement.

**Type B (Exemplar Pivot)** positions AI as a model provider following Hanauer's (2010) imitation-transformation approach to L2 poetry writing. AI supplies templates, examples, or comparative texts that students adapt for their creative purposes.

**Type C (Surprise Harvest)** leverages AI's capacity for serendipitous discovery as documented by Coenen et al. (2022). AI generates unexpected combinations or novel suggestions that inspire creative directions previously unconsidered by students.

## 3.3 Experimental Conditions

Four web-based environments were implemented to ensure experimental control and eliminate cross-contamination between conditions. Each room employed identical system prompts with only parameter settings and interface awareness varied.

The Structured configuration (temperature=0.3, top-p=0.4) was designed to produce coherent, predictable outputs favoring systematic scaffolding and educational feedback. This configuration was hypothesized to increase Type A (Diagnosis → Repair) and Type B (Exemplar Pivot) interactions through consistent, methodical AI responses.

The Exploratory configuration (temperature=0.8, top-p=0.9) was designed to generate creative, diverse outputs with unexpected combinations. This configuration was hypothesized to increase Type C (Surprise Harvest) interactions through surprising, inspirational AI contributions.

Interface awareness was manipulated through parameter transparency: Aware conditions displayed technical settings with educational explanations, while Unaware conditions provided standard creative writing interfaces without parameter visibility. Sequential balanced assignment allocated five participants per condition (n=5 each) to ensure equal distribution while preventing randomization artifacts.

## 3.10 Summary

This methodology employs a rigorous experimental design that systematically manipulates AI parameter settings while controlling for awareness bias to examine how different LLM configurations affect collaborative interaction patterns in L2 poetry writing contexts. The four-room architecture ensures experimental control while the mixed-methods approach provides comprehensive insights into both quantitative parameter effects and qualitative collaboration experiences.

The **Three Interaction Types framework** provides theoretical grounding for analyzing how **Diagnosis → Repair**, **Exemplar Pivot**, and **Surprise Harvest** interactions emerge under different parameter conditions, while the **unaware control group design** ensures detection of pure parameter effects without awareness bias. Integration of quantitative interaction frequency analysis with qualitative conversation analysis enables robust conclusions about optimal AI configurations for L2 creative writing pedagogy.

The methodology addresses identified gaps in human-AI creativity research by focusing specifically on L2 learners, systematic parameter manipulation, and educational context integration while maintaining rigorous experimental standards for validity, reliability, and ethical conduct. Results will provide evidence-based recommendations for AI parameter configuration in L2 creative writing instruction and advance theoretical understanding of human-AI collaborative creativity in educational contexts.
