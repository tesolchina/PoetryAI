# Background, Literature Review, and Research Questions

## 1. Background

### 1.1 Introduction

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fundamentally transformed creative writing pedagogy, particularly in second language (L2) contexts where learners face dual challenges of linguistic competence and creative expression (Li, 2025). Recent advances in AI-assisted writing tools demonstrate significant potential for supporting L2 poetry composition through collaborative human-AI interaction (Coenen inet al., 2022; Chakrabarty et al., 2022). However, critical questions remain regarding how specific AI parameter configurations affect the quality and nature of these collaborative interactions, particularly in structured educational settings.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

While existing research has established the pedagogical value of human-AI creative collaboration (Clark et al., 2018; Qian et al., 2023), limited empirical investigation exists into how LLM generation parameters—specifically temperature and top-p nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019)—influence the collaborative process in L2 poetry writing contexts. Temperature controls response variability through probability distribution adjustment (Li et al., 2025), while top-p determines vocabulary selection scope through nucleus sampling (Ravfogel et al., 2023). These parameters fundamentally shape AI output characteristics, yet their pedagogical implications for L2 creative writing remain underexplored.

Furthermore, most human-AI creativity studies focus on experienced writers or native speakers (Ippolito et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2024), leaving significant gaps in understanding how L2 learners—who simultaneously navigate linguistic constraints and creative goals—experience and benefit from AI-mediated poetry composition. This study addresses these gaps by systematically examining how parameter configurations affect collaborative interaction patterns in controlled L2 educational environments, using unaware control conditions to isolate pure parameter effects from potential awareness bias.

### 1.3 Theoretical Framework

This research builds on three established frameworks: **L2 creative writing pedagogy** (Hanauer, 2010), **corrective feedback and uptake theory** (Lyster & Ranta, 1997), and **human-AI co-creativity research** (Coenen et al., 2022). We conceptualize AI-human poetry collaboration as involving three distinct interaction types, each serving different pedagogical functions:

**Type A: Diagnosis → Repair** occurs when AI identifies structural, formal, or linguistic issues in student drafts and provides targeted corrections or suggestions. This interaction type aligns with Lyster and Ranta's (1997) corrective feedback taxonomy, where AI functions as a diagnostic tool that surfaces specific areas needing attention—from meter irregularities to unclear imagery—enabling focused revision activities.

**Type B: Exemplar Pivot** involves AI providing model texts, templates, or comparative examples that students can adapt or transform for their own creative purposes. Grounded in Hanauer's (2010) imitation-transformation pedagogy, this interaction type supports scaffolded learning where students analyze exemplary features before applying similar techniques in their own work.

**Type C: Surprise Harvest** emerges when AI generates unexpected creative possibilities that inspire new directions or reveal previously unconsidered options. Following Coenen et al.'s (2022) findings on serendipitous discovery in human-AI collaboration, this interaction type capitalizes on AI's capacity to expand creative search spaces and offer novel combinatorial possibilities.

### 1.4 Study Significance

This research contributes to three domains: **L2 creative writing pedagogy** by providing empirical evidence for optimal AI parameter configurations in poetry instruction; **human-AI interaction research** by examining collaborative patterns in constrained creative tasks; and **educational technology** by establishing evidence-based guidelines for implementing AI writing assistants in L2 contexts.

The study's significance extends beyond academic inquiry to practical applications in language education, where AI tools are increasingly integrated without sufficient pedagogical grounding. By systematically examining how technical parameters translate into educational outcomes, this research provides educators with evidence-based frameworks for maximizing AI's pedagogical potential while preserving authentic human creative agency.

Moreover, this investigation addresses critical questions about human-AI creative partnership in educational contexts, examining not merely whether AI can support L2 creative writing, but how different configurations of AI behavior affect the collaborative process and learning outcomes. Understanding these dynamics is essential as AI writing tools become ubiquitous in educational settings, requiring informed integration that serves pedagogical rather than merely technological objectives.

## 2. Literature Review

This review examines existing research across three key domains: L2 creative writing pedagogy, human-AI collaborative creativity, and LLM parameter effects. The review establishes theoretical foundations for the three interaction types framework (Diagnosis → Repair, Exemplar Pivot, Surprise Harvest) and identifies gaps that this study addresses.

### 2.1 L2 Creative Writing and Poetry Pedagogy

Poetry writing in second language contexts presents unique pedagogical opportunities that distinguish it from other forms of L2 writing instruction. Hanauer (2010) established poetry as a legitimate pedagogical tool, demonstrating that poetic expression allows L2 learners to explore language creatively while developing both linguistic competence and personal voice. His longitudinal study revealed that students develop metalinguistic awareness through poetic composition, particularly when engaging with formal constraints, establishing the pedagogical rationale for our **Type B: Exemplar Pivot** interaction type.

Fithriani (2021) extended this work by examining Indonesian EFL students' poetry composition strategies, identifying three key approaches: **imitation-based learning**, **emotion-driven expression**, and **collaborative construction**. Her analysis reveals that students benefit most from structured progression through these approaches, with imitation serving as crucial scaffolding before independent creative expression. Kerbs, McQueston, and Lawrance (2024) further developed this scaffolding dimension, demonstrating how systematic poetry instruction supports overall writing development through **constraint-based creativity**—using formal structures to support rather than limit creative expression.

The integration of technology into L2 creative writing has evolved significantly with AI tools. Li (2025) provides comprehensive analysis of generative AI applications in L2 writing contexts, distinguishing between **generative support**, **collaborative support**, and **evaluative support**, with collaborative applications showing greatest promise for creative writing instruction. His research emphasizes maintaining student agency in AI-assisted writing, arguing that tools should enhance rather than replace human creative decision-making.

### 2.2 Human-AI Creative Collaboration

Research into human-AI creative partnerships has established foundational frameworks for understanding collaborative dynamics. Clark et al. (2018) identified three primary collaboration patterns: **AI as idea generator**, **AI as writing assistant**, and **AI as creative partner**. This framework is significantly expanded by Coenen et al. (2022) through their analysis of Wordcraft, an LLM-based story writing tool, revealing that successful collaboration depends on **serendipitous discovery**—moments when AI generates unexpected content that inspires new creative directions. This finding directly informs our **Type C: Surprise Harvest** interaction type.

Coenen et al.'s work demonstrates how AI parameter settings affect collaborative dynamics, observing that higher temperature settings (0.7-0.9) generated more surprising content, while lower settings (0.1-0.3) provided predictable outputs. However, their focus on experienced writers leaves gaps regarding L2 learners who lack extensive linguistic resources. Qian et al. (2023) address this through detailed process analysis of human-AI co-creativity, revealing that AI collaboration affects cognitive load distribution, with AI handling ideational generation while humans focus on evaluation and integration.

Michel et al. (2025) provide direct relevance to L2 contexts through analysis of collaborative writing with generative AI in German L2 classrooms, revealing that AI assistance improves drafting efficiency but requires explicit instruction in critical evaluation of AI suggestions. Nguyen et al. (2024) identify four collaboration modes—**directive**, **consultative**, **collaborative**, and **autonomous**—with collaborative mode producing highest satisfaction but requiring substantial user expertise, suggesting important implications for L2 contexts where students may lack linguistic confidence for true collaborative relationships.

### 2.3 LLM Parameters and Generation Control

Technical literature on LLM parameters provides crucial background for understanding how AI configuration affects creative collaboration. Peeperkorn et al. (2024) directly address whether temperature functions as a creativity parameter, finding that temperature affects **lexical diversity**, **semantic coherence**, and **creative surprise**, but its relationship to human-perceived creativity is complex and task-dependent. Their analysis reveals that low temperature (0.1-0.3) produces **highly coherent but predictable outputs**, while high temperature (0.8-1.0) generates **surprising but potentially incoherent content**.

Li et al. (2025) extend this analysis to L2 writing contexts, examining temperature effects on vocabulary complexity, grammatical accuracy, and creative expression in AI-assisted writing tasks with Chinese L2 English writers, finding that intermediate settings (0.5-0.6) optimize the balance between linguistic accessibility and creative stimulation. Ravfogel, Goldberg, and Goldberger (2023) provide technical analysis of nucleus sampling (top-p) effects, demonstrating that top-p affects **vocabulary breadth**, **semantic consistency**, and **stylistic variation**, with low values providing linguistic scaffolding and high values offering vocabulary expansion opportunities.

Holtzman et al. (2019) established foundational understanding of neural text degeneration, demonstrating that top-p sampling produces more **human-like text** than alternative approaches. Ippolito et al. (2022) explored user experience dimensions, finding that parameter transparency affects user trust and creative satisfaction, though their focus on expert users leaves questions about optimal parameter presentation for novice L2 writers.

### 2.4 Feedback and Interaction Analysis

The theoretical foundation for our **Type A: Diagnosis → Repair** interaction type derives from Lyster and Ranta's (1997) seminal work on corrective feedback and learner uptake in communicative classrooms. Their taxonomy of feedback types—**explicit correction**, **recasts**, **clarification requests**, **metalinguistic feedback**, **elicitation**, and **repetition**—provides a framework for analyzing how AI might function as a feedback provider in creative writing contexts. Their analysis revealed that explicit correction and metalinguistic feedback showed highest uptake rates, suggesting that AI systems configured for explicit diagnostic feedback might be more effective for immediate learning.

Wang and Wang (2025) extend corrective feedback analysis to AI-assisted writing contexts through their APSE (Analyze, Plan, Synthesize, Evaluate) model for critical AI literacy, emphasizing that effective AI feedback requires **explicit instruction in feedback interpretation** and **strategic response planning**.

### 2.5 Research Gaps and Study Positioning

#### 2.5.1 Identified Gaps

Despite substantial research in human-AI creative collaboration, significant gaps remain in understanding how parameter configurations affect L2 creative writing pedagogy. Existing studies focus primarily on **native speakers** (Coenen et al., 2022; Ippolito et al., 2022) or **general writing tasks** (Michel et al., 2025; Wang, 2024) rather than specifically examining **poetry composition** in **L2 educational contexts** with **systematic parameter manipulation**.

The **methodological validation dimension** represents another significant gap. While research establishes that parameter settings affect output characteristics (Peeperkorn et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025), limited investigation exists into whether these effects represent genuine technical impacts or artifacts of user expectation. This gap is particularly relevant for educational contexts, where parameter-based pedagogical recommendations must be grounded in actual AI behavior differences rather than user perception biases.

The **interaction type framework** developed in this study addresses gaps in understanding how different AI behaviors support different learning objectives. While Lyster and Ranta's (1997) corrective feedback taxonomy provides foundation for diagnostic interactions, and Hanauer's (2010) imitation-transformation approach supports exemplar-based learning, limited research examines how **AI parameter configurations** can be strategically employed to facilitate these different interaction types.

#### 2.5.2 Study Contributions

This research addresses identified gaps through several key contributions:

1. **Systematic parameter manipulation in L2 creative writing contexts**, examining how temperature and top-p settings affect collaborative poetry composition with specific attention to L2 learner needs and capabilities.

2. **Methodological validation through control design**, using unaware control conditions to demonstrate that parameter effects represent genuine technical impacts on AI behavior rather than user expectation artifacts, establishing the validity of parameter-based pedagogical recommendations.

3. **Three interaction types framework**, providing theoretical structure for understanding how different AI behaviors (Diagnosis → Repair, Exemplar Pivot, Surprise Harvest) support different pedagogical objectives in L2 creative writing instruction.

4. **Mixed-methods empirical validation**, combining interaction analysis, linguistic analysis, and participant feedback to provide comprehensive understanding of human-AI creative collaboration in L2 educational contexts.

These contributions advance both **theoretical understanding** of human-AI creative collaboration and **practical knowledge** for implementing AI tools in L2 creative writing pedagogy, addressing calls for more systematic research into educational applications of generative AI (Li, 2025; Michel et al., 2025).

#### 2.5.3 Theoretical Framework Integration

The literature review establishes three theoretical pillars that support this study's conceptual framework:

**L2 Creative Writing Pedagogy** (Hanauer, 2010; Fithriani, 2021; Kerbs et al., 2024) demonstrates that poetry writing serves both linguistic development and creative expression functions in L2 contexts, with scaffolding and constraint-based approaches showing particular effectiveness.

**Human-AI Creative Collaboration** (Coenen et al., 2022; Qian et al., 2023; Clark et al., 2018) reveals that successful creative partnerships depend on strategic role distribution, serendipitous discovery opportunities, and appropriate transparency about AI capabilities.

**LLM Parameter Effects** (Peeperkorn et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025; Ravfogel et al., 2023) establish that temperature and top-p settings significantly affect output creativity, coherence, and linguistic accessibility, with optimal configurations being task- and user-specific.

Integration of these three domains through the lens of **interaction analysis** (Lyster & Ranta, 1997; McGregor et al., 2016) provides the theoretical foundation for investigating how parameter configurations can be strategically employed to support different types of pedagogically valuable interactions in L2 creative writing contexts.

## 3. Research Questions

Based on the theoretical framework and literature review findings, this study investigates how different LLM parameter configurations influence the three interaction types in L2 poetry writing contexts through the following research questions:

### 3.1 Primary Research Questions

**Research Question 1: How do structured (low temperature/top-p) versus exploratory (high temperature/top-p) parameter settings affect the frequency and quality of each interaction type?**

This question examines the central hypothesis that parameter configurations systematically influence collaborative interaction patterns. Based on the literature review, we predict that structured settings (temperature=0.3, top-p=0.4) will favor Type A (Diagnosis → Repair) and Type B (Exemplar Pivot) interactions through consistent, methodical AI responses, while exploratory settings (temperature=0.8, top-p=0.9) will enhance Type C (Surprise Harvest) interactions through unexpected, creative AI contributions.

**Research Question 2: Do parameter configurations genuinely affect AI generative output and collaborative interactions, independent of user awareness?**

This question addresses the fundamental question of whether parameter effects are genuine technical phenomena or artifacts of user expectation. The unaware control conditions serve as the primary analysis groups to isolate pure parameter effects, while aware conditions help validate that any observed differences stem from actual parameter changes rather than user bias or expectation effects.

**Research Question 3: How do different parameter configurations support or hinder L2 learners' development of poetic craft and creative confidence?**

This question focuses on educational outcomes, examining whether structured and exploratory configurations produce different learning trajectories in terms of technical proficiency, creative originality, linguistic development, and collaborative satisfaction.

### 3.2 Secondary Research Questions

**Research Question 4: What patterns emerge in the sequencing and chaining of interaction types during collaborative poetry composition sessions?**

This question examines the temporal dynamics of human-AI collaboration, investigating how different parameter configurations influence the flow and integration of diagnostic, exemplar, and creative discovery interactions within individual sessions and across the six-week study period.

**Research Question 5: How do individual learner characteristics (learning style, proficiency level, creative orientation) interact with parameter effects to influence collaborative outcomes?**

This question acknowledges that optimal parameter configurations may vary based on individual differences, examining whether personalized parameter selection strategies might enhance educational effectiveness.

### 3.3 Research Hypotheses

Based on the theoretical framework and literature review, we propose the following hypotheses:

**Hypothesis 1**: Structured parameter configurations will significantly increase Type A (Diagnosis → Repair) and Type B (Exemplar Pivot) interaction frequencies compared to exploratory configurations, while exploratory configurations will significantly increase Type C (Surprise Harvest) interactions.

**Hypothesis 2**: Parameter configurations will show consistent effects across both aware and unaware conditions, demonstrating that parameter differences reflect genuine technical effects on AI output rather than user expectation artifacts, with unaware control groups providing the cleanest measure of parameter impact.

**Hypothesis 3**: Structured configurations will produce superior outcomes in technical proficiency and systematic skill development, while exploratory configurations will enhance creative confidence and linguistic experimentation.

**Hypothesis 4**: Both parameter configurations will maintain educational effectiveness, but through different pedagogical pathways—structured through scaffolded skill building and exploratory through creative inspiration and discovery.

These research questions and hypotheses provide the foundation for systematic investigation of parameter effects in L2 creative writing contexts, addressing identified gaps while contributing to both theoretical understanding and practical application of educational AI tools.
