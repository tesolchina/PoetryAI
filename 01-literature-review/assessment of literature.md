## Conclusion

The literature collection provides a strong foundation for the PoetryAI research project, with particularly excellent coverage of human-AI collaboration and L2 writing contexts. The discovery of Chakrabarty et al. (2022) as a near-perfect match significantly strengthens the theoretical foundation. 

The main enhancement needed is the addition of technical parameter studies and classical DDL foundations to complete the theoretical framework. The collection demonstrates good currency and relevance to contemporary challenges in AI-assisted language learning.

**Recommended next steps:**
1. Conduct focused searches for the identified gaps
2. Prioritize the high-relevance sources for in-depth review
3. Consider reaching out to authors of the most relevant recent studies
4. Develop a systematic review protocol for the complete literature analysis
