## Slide 6: During Session Support

### **üìä Session Monitoring Protocol**

#### **Your Role During 55-Minute Sessions:**
- **Stay nearby but not intrusive** - participants should feel natural

#### **When to Intervene:**
‚úÖ **Technical failures:** Chat stops working, AI doesn't respond, audio issues  
‚úÖ **Participant requests help:** Login problems, interface confusion  
‚úÖ **Obvious distress:** Participant seems very frustrated or stuck  

#### **When NOT to Intervene:**
‚ùå **Creative struggles** - let them work with AI naturally  
‚ùå **Slow responses** - unless participant specifically asks for help  
‚ùå **Different room curiosity** - redirect focus to their assigned room  

#### **Session Notes Template:**
```
Participant ID: _____ Room: _____ Date/Time: _____
Technical Issues: _________________________________
Participant Questions: ____________________________
Session Completion: ______________________________
```
