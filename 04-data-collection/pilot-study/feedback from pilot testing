## üìä **Questionnaire Design Rationale**

### **Question Distribution Strategy:**
- **Technical Validation (Q1-3):** System performance, usability, response quality
- **AI Collaboration (Q4-7):** Helpfulness, style recognition, appropriateness, satisfaction
- **Overall Experience (Q8-10):** Engagement, recommendation, learning value
- **Condition-Specific:** Awareness impact assessment

### **Response Format Benefits:**
‚úÖ **5-point Likert scales** - Quantifiable data with clear gradations  
‚úÖ **Specific descriptors** - Clear interpretation and consistent responses  
‚úÖ **Balanced options** - Equal positive/negative choices with neutral middle  
‚úÖ **Targeted questions** - Each question addresses specific validation needs  

### **Analysis Mapping:**
```
Technical Readiness Assessment:
- Q1 (Technical Performance) + Q2 (Usability) + Q3 (Response Speed)
- Success Threshold: ‚â•80% "Good" or "Excellent" responses

AI Effectiveness Validation:
- Q4 (Helpfulness) + Q5 (Style Recognition) + Q6 (Appropriateness) + Q7 (Output Satisfaction)
- Success Threshold: ‚â•80% "Moderately Helpful" or higher + Style recognition accuracy

Research Value Confirmation:
- Q8 (Engagement) + Q9 (Recommendation) + Q10 (Learning Value)
- Success Threshold: ‚â•80% positive responses across all three measures

Condition Effect Measurement:
- Condition-specific follow-up questions for awareness impact assessment
- Cross-room comparison analysis for parameter and awareness effects
```

### **Data Collection Efficiency:**
‚úÖ **10-minute completion time** - Respects participant time while gathering essential data  
‚úÖ **Quantifiable responses** - Enables statistical analysis and comparison  
‚úÖ **Open-ended opportunities** - Captures unexpected insights and suggestions  
‚úÖ **Condition validation** - Directly assesses experimental manipulation effectiveness
