Section C.  Research Protocol and Documentation 
Summary of the research
Please provide a summary stating the general nature and purpose of the proposed research, and where the study will take place. 

This study investigates how English L2 undergraduates co-create poems with a Large Language Model (LLM) while manipulating parameters such as temperature and top-p to shape output variability. The research aims to understand classroom interactions in L2 poetry writing with AI as co-creation partners, specifically examining how parameter settings condition learners' inquiry moves, scaffolding dynamics, and collaborative creativity patterns. Students in a university creative writing course will complete scaffolding tasks drafting, critiquing, and redrafting poems with a customized chatbot under contrasting parameter settings (low vs. high temperature/top-p). The study will take place at Hong Kong Baptist University in classroom 0EE702, Old Campus, during regularly scheduled class time.

INFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT CHECKLIST

An Informed Consent Statement has two purposes: 
	(1) to enable potential research subjects to make an informed choice as to their participation in a study, and 
	(2) to document their decision to participate. 
In order to make an informed choice, potential subjects must understand the study, how they are involved in the study, what sort of risks it poses to them, and what to do if something untoward happens. The words and language used to describe these factors must be understandable to potential subjects. 

A Study Information Sheet has the same purpose listed in (1) above. The subject's participation is considered consent; their signature is not required.  

Samples of a Consent Statement and an Information Sheet are provided in Appendix A1 - 4.  Following the sample format will help to ensure that the necessary criteria for approval are included.  Checking off an item as it is written into the statement/sheet will assist you in assuring that each element has been addressed in the document. 

Items to be included in the Consent Statement and the Information Sheet

Informed Consent Statement required elements: Items 1-9. Each must be included in the informed consent statement submitted. Study Information Sheet required elements: Items 1-8. Each must be included in the study information sheet submitted. 
These elements are incorporated into the SAMPLES that follow in Appendix A1 - 4.  

1.	Use the heading "Hong Kong Baptist University, Informed Consent Statement" or "Hong Kong Baptist University, Study Information Sheet".

2.	List the title of the project as given in Section A.

3.	Invite the subjects to participate and state that the study involves research and describe the following:
		a.	purpose
		b.	procedures (identify any that are experimental)
		c.	expected duration of the subject's participation
		d.	reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts
		e.	safeguards to be used to minimize risks
		f.	any benefits to the subject or to others; or the extent of contribution to the body of literature/knowledge

4.	Describe the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained. 

	If subjects are identified in reports, signed consent is required. If research is conducted over the internet, you must tell subjects that you cannot guarantee confidentiality while their data is on the internet.

5.	State the terms of subject compensation for study participation, if any. If the subjects will be paid (or receive other compensation) for participation, state how and when they will receive payment and/or compensation (i.e., compensation = toys, books, gifts, etc.). List the value of gifts or services. Explain if there will be any partial payment if the subject withdraws prior to completion of the study. If class credit will be given, list the amount and list alternative ways to earn the same amount of credit.  

6.	Include an invitation for the subject to ask any questions at any time about the study and its procedures, or their rights as subjects. Also, if applicable, include a statement that if the subject experiences adverse effects, the project team member should be contacted immediately.

7.	Include the project team member's name, address, and telephone number that the subject may use to ask questions and report any study related problems

8.	Tell the subject that participation is voluntary. Further, state that refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, and the subject may discontinue participation at any time without penalty, or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. Tell subjects what will happen to their data if they withdraw from the study.

9.	Include a statement that says subject has read and understands the consent form, acknowledges receiving a copy of the form, and agrees to participate in the study. Provide a line for signature(s) and the date.  Provide two copies of the Consent Form, one to be retained by the subject and one to be signed by the subject and, if applicable, the subject's parent(s)/guardian/legal representative and returned to you.

If subjects are minors use the following guidelines for obtaining consent:
6 years old and younger - only parent(s)/guardian/legal representative need sign;
7-8 years old - signature of minor is optional, requires signature of parent(s)/guardian/legal representative;
9 through 17 years old - requires signature of both minor and parent(s)/guardian/legal representative.

INFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT CHECKLIST (Continued)

When appropriate, one or more of the following additional elements of information (items 10-18) shall also be provided to each subject, in either the Informed Consent Statement or Study Information Sheet:

10.	The consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the research and procedures for orderly termination of participation by the subject. (Explain what will happen to data if a subject withdraws. If data are gathered that contain subject identifiers, the disposition of the data must be stated.)  

11.	The approximate number of subjects involved in the study should be indicated when the subject population is small in number. If subjects might be identifiable in reports because individual responses will be described, a statement to this effect should be included in the consent statement or information sheet.

12.	If you plan to audio tape, videotape or film the subjects, you have to request permission to do so in writing and indicate how you will be using this material (Research purposes only? Research and instruction? Who will have access to or view the tapes? Will subjects be allowed to preview the tapes? What will happen to the tapes at the end of the study? What will happen to the tapes if the subject withdraws?). All possible uses of the tapes/films/photos (current & future) must be described. If tapes are kept by the SI beyond the end of the study and/or archived, then the following statement must be included: “The tapes/films/photos will not be used for any additional purposes without your additional permission.” and signed/documented consent is required.

13.	IF DECEPTION IS USED, include a statement to the effect that the research cannot be fully described at this time, but at the conclusion of participation, an explanation will be provided. (Provide a copy of the debriefing script with your packet for Committee review.)
 
14.	Emergency Medical Treatment.  If the study involves risk procedures (exercise, medical, stress, alcohol, and so on), the following paragraph is to be included:
		"In the unlikely event of physical injury resulting from your participation in this research, emergency medical treatment will be provided at no cost to you. Be certain that you immediately notify the researcher if you are injured. If you require additional medical treatment you will be responsible for the cost. No other compensation will be provided if you are injured in this research."

15.	A statement that the particular treatment or procedure may involve currently unforeseeable risks to the subject (or to the embryo or fetus, if the subject is or may become pregnant).

16.	Anticipated circumstances under which the subject's participation may be terminated by the project team member without regard to the subject's consent.

17.	Any additional costs to the subject that may result from participation in the research. (If subjects will be charged for participation in the research project, then all costs must be itemized on the consent form. If alternative, non-investigational procedures are available, then these procedures should be discussed and the average costs included in the consent form.)

18.	A statement that significant new findings developed during the course of the research, and which may be related to the subject's willingness to continue participation, will be provided to the subject.

NOTES TO PROJECT TEAM:

1.Researchers are urged by -REC to use the wording in the checklist and sample, as it applies to their study, and to follow the format of the sample, unless researcher supported reasons are provided for the alternatives. Use of unnecessary alternative wording or different format may slow down the review process. The form should be written in second person ("You are invited..."). Use of first person ("I") can be interpreted as suggestive and coercive.

^This phrase should only be included when the study also requires the use of the Emergency Medical Treatment Statement.

2.Study Information Sheets for mail surveys may take the format of a letter, as long as all the required information is included.

3.If the Informed Consent Statement or Study Information Sheet is to be in a foreign language, submit the foreign language version and an English translation.

4.Be sure to follow the directions in item 9 on the checklist for preparing the signature lines. Separate forms should be prepared when young minors are used; one for the minors and one for the parents. If the minors are age 15 and above a single form may be acceptable with signature lines for both the minor and parent.  

5.If your form is more than one page, there should be a line at the bottom of each page for the subject's initials, except for the last page where the signature is obtained.

6.Be sure to include any of the items 10-18 on the Informed Consent Statement Checklist that are appropriate to your study. While items 15-18 are not specifically covered in the sample, if they apply to your study they must be included.
