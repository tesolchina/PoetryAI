## üí° **Implementation Tips**

1. **For Canva/Figma**: Use these prompts as design briefs, create templates first
2. **For AI Tools (DALL-E, Midjourney)**: May need to break complex diagrams into simpler components
3. **For Academic Software (R/ggplot, Python/matplotlib)**: Adapt prompts for code-based generation
4. **For PowerPoint/Keynote**: Use prompts as guides for slide-by-slide creation

### **Suggested Creation Order:**
1. Graph 1 (Experimental Design) - Foundation
2. Graph 2 (Interaction Types) - Theory  
3. Graph 4 (Analysis Framework) - Methods
4. Graph 3 (Timeline) - Implementation
5. Graph 5 (Architecture) - Technical
6. Graph 6 (Parameters) - Details
7. Graph 7 (Alignment) - Integration
