## Research Objectives Analysis

### Overall Objective

> "Provide a process-oriented account of how English L2 undergraduates to progress with a generative model while co-creating poems under different parameter regimes, and derive a practically oriented ranking of interaction types most useful for instruction."

**Literature Grounding & Commentary:**

This objective is well-aligned with current trends in Human-AI collaboration research. The focus on **process-oriented** rather than product-oriented analysis reflects:

- **Qian et al. (2023)**: "'It Felt Like Having a Second Mind'" - emphasizes the importance of understanding the collaborative process in human-AI creative writing
- **Michel et al. (2025)**: Focus on "revision and deliberation process" in AI-assisted L2 writing
- **McGregor et al. (2016)**: Call for "process-based evaluation" in computational creativity

**Strengths:**
1. **Process focus**: Addresses gap in current literature that often focuses on final products
2. **Practical orientation**: Clear connection to pedagogical applications
3. **Parameter manipulation**: Novel approach to understanding AI controllability in educational contexts

**Areas for Development:**
1. Define "progress" more clearly - what constitutes successful progression?
2. Specify criteria for "usefulness for instruction" beyond frequency and impact metrics

### Specific Objectives Analysis

#### Objective 1: Parameter Effects on Learner Inquiry Moves
> "Describe and compare learner inquiry moves (creativity strategies; stylistic patterning; appeals to exemplars) when interacting with a customized chatbot under low vs. high variability settings"

**Literature Context:**
- **Holtzman et al. (2019)**: Technical foundation for temperature/top-p effects on text generation
- **Clark et al. (2018)**: "Creative writing with a machine in the loop" - establishes precedent for studying human-AI creative collaboration
- **Crosthwaite & Baisa (2023)**: DDL framework provides theoretical grounding for "inquiry moves"

**Commentary:**
- **Novel contribution**: First study to systematically examine parameter literacy in L2 creative writing contexts
- **Methodological strength**: Clear operationalization of inquiry moves (creativity, stylistic patterns, exemplars)
- **Gap addressed**: Lack of research on how technical parameters affect pedagogical interactions

#### Objective 2: Collaborative Dynamics Analysis
> "Examine collaborative dynamics (evaluation, negotiation of meaning, co-construction of poetic choices) and how these differ by parameter settings"

**Literature Grounding:**
- **Scaffolding theory** (Vygotsky): Provides framework for understanding teacher/peer support
- **Negotiation of meaning** (Long): Established SLA construct applicable to human-AI interaction
- **Co-construction**: Aligns with collaborative writing research (Michel et al., 2025)

**Strengths:**
- Integrates established SLA theory with novel AI context
- Multi-level analysis (teacher, peer, AI scaffolding)

**Considerations:**
- Need to distinguish between human-human and human-AI negotiation of meaning
- How do traditional scaffolding patterns change with AI mediation?

#### Objective 3: Ranking Interaction Types
> "Operationalize and rank creative DDL interaction types by usefulness for instruction based on frequency, sequencing, and impact on revision and metalinguistic talk"

**Literature Connection:**
- **DDL tradition** (Johns, 1991; Boulton, 2012): Provides framework for data-driven learning
- **Metalinguistic awareness** research: Strong predictor of L2 writing development
- **Usage-based linguistics**: Frequency as indicator of salience/importance

**Innovation:**
- First attempt to create empirically-grounded ranking of interaction types for AI-assisted creative writing
- Integration of frequency, sequence, and impact metrics

## Research Questions Analysis

### RQ1: Parameter Effects on Inquiry Moves
> "How do parameter settings (low vs. high temperature/top p) condition learners' inquiry moves and appeals to exemplars during poem co-creation?"

**Theoretical Framework:**
- **Controllable generation**: Builds on Holtzman et al.'s technical work
- **Creative cognition**: Connects to creativity research on constraint vs. freedom
- **Exemplar theory**: How models/examples guide learning (Gentner & Markman, 1997)

**Predicted Contributions:**
1. First empirical evidence of parameter effects on creative learning processes
2. Bridge between technical AI research and educational applications
3. Evidence for parameter literacy as pedagogical tool

**Methodological Considerations:**
- Clear operationalization of "inquiry moves" needed
- Control for individual differences in creativity/language proficiency
- Awareness vs. unaware conditions add crucial dimension

### RQ2: Scaffolding Patterns
> "What forms of teacher/peer scaffolding emerge, and how do learners take up this scaffolding across parameter conditions?"

**Literature Base:**
- **Scaffolding theory**: Wood, Bruner & Ross (1976) - systematic support structures
- **L2 writing scaffolding**: Research on effective support in creative writing contexts
- **Technology-mediated scaffolding**: How AI changes traditional patterns

**Novel Aspects:**
- AI as scaffolding provider vs. tool requiring scaffolding
- Parameter settings as scaffolding mechanism
- Multi-source scaffolding (teacher + peer + AI)

### RQ3: Collaborative Dynamics
> "How do collaborative dynamics (evaluation, negotiation, co-creation) unfold and vary by parameter settings?"

**Theoretical Grounding:**
- **Collaborative writing** research (Storch, 2013)
- **Computer-supported collaborative learning** (CSCL)
- **Human-AI collaboration** (Wang & Zhaozhe, 2025)

**Key Innovation:**
- Parameter settings as independent variable affecting collaboration patterns
- Creative writing context (vs. typical academic writing research)

### RQ4: Instructional Usefulness Ranking
> "Which interaction types are most useful for instruction, as indicated by their frequency, sequencing centrality, and impact on revision and metalinguistic talk?"

**Framework:**
- **Evidence-based pedagogy**: Data-driven approach to instructional design
- **Usage-based learning**: Frequency effects in language acquisition
- **Metalinguistic awareness**: Strong predictor of writing development

- **Suggestion**: Power analysis for quantitative comparisons, or focus primarily on qualitative insights

#### 2. Validity Considerations
- **Parameter fidelity**: Good plan to log actual settings
- **Construct validity**: Need clear operational definitions of "creativity," "usefulness," etc.
- **External validity**: Single institution, specific context - generalizability questions

#### 3. Analysis Framework
- **Interaction coding**: Three-type framework (A, B, C) well-conceived but may need refinement after pilot
- **Statistical analysis**: Need to specify tests for parameter condition comparisons
- **Qualitative analysis**: Thematic analysis approach needs more detailed protocol
