## Referral Tracking Template

**To keep track of referrals:**

| Original Participant | Referred Friend(s) | Friend's Email | Status | Bonus Paid |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|--------|------------|
| P001 - [Name] | [Friend Name] | [Email] | Registered / Completed / Pending | Yes / No |
| P002 - [Name] | [Friend 1], [Friend 2] | [Emails] | Completed, Pending | HKD 50 paid |

---

## Important Notes for Implementation

### Ethical Considerations:
- ✅ Ensure referral bonus doesn't create undue pressure
- ✅ Referred participants must still meet eligibility criteria
- ✅ Referred participants should feel free to participate (or not) without obligation to their friend
- ✅ Maintain confidentiality (don't share details about who completed/didn't complete)

### Payment Logistics:
- Specify when bonus is paid (e.g., "within 1 week after your friend completes both sessions")
- Clarify payment method (gift coupon, cash, e-wallet transfer)
- Set clear tracking system to avoid confusion
- Include bonus in ethics approval/budget planning

### Referral Limits (Optional):
Consider setting a cap if budget limited:
- "Up to 3 referral bonuses per participant" 
- "First 20 successful referrals will receive bonus"
- Or: unlimited if budget allows and you need participants urgently

### Communication Clarity:
- Make sure participants understand friend must complete BOTH sessions
- Clarify timeline for receiving bonus
- Provide easy way for participants to check referral status
