## 1. Sample Composition

### 1.1 Academic Year Distribution

| Year Level | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|------------|
| Year 1     | 10    | 50%        |
| Year 2     | 5     | 25%        |
| Year 3     | 4     | 20%        |
| Year 4     | 1     | 5%         |

**Key Finding:** The sample is predominantly composed of first-year students (50%), with decreasing representation in higher years.

### 1.2 English Proficiency Levels

| Proficiency Level | Description | Count | Percentage |
|-------------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| C2 - Proficient   | Can understand virtually everything | 8 | 40% |
| C1 - Advanced     | Can express ideas fluently and spontaneously | 9 | 45% |
| B2 - Upper Intermediate | Can interact fluently with native speakers | 3 | 15% |

**Key Finding:** 85% of participants demonstrate advanced or proficient English levels (C1-C2), indicating strong linguistic competence suitable for creative writing tasks.

### 1.3 Poetry Writing Experience

| Experience Level | Count | Percentage |
|------------------|-------|------------|
| No experience with poetry writing | 9 | 45% |
| Beginner (written a few poems) | 10 | 50% |
| Intermediate (regularly write poetry) | 1 | 5% |

**Key Finding:** 95% of participants are novice poets (no experience or beginner level), with only one participant having intermediate experience.

## 3. Key Research Implications

### 3.1 Strengths of Current Sample

1. **High English Proficiency**
   - 40% at native-like proficiency (C2)
   - 85% at advanced levels (C1-C2)
   - Minimizes language barriers, allowing focus on creative and poetic elements

2. **Homogeneous Poetry Experience**
   - Limited variation in poetry writing background
   - Reduces confounding variables
   - Facilitates comparison across participants

3. **Appropriate Sample Size**
   - N=20 adequate for qualitative and mixed-methods research
   - Sufficient for thematic analysis and case studies
   - Manageable for intensive intervention and data collection

### 3.2 Considerations for Study Design

1. **Instructional Scaffolding Required**
   - 95% novice poets require careful pedagogical design
   - Need foundational poetry instruction before/during AI interaction
   - Should incorporate basic poetic concepts and terminology

2. **Generalizability Limitations**
   - Results may not extend to experienced poets
   - Findings specific to novice L2 poetry writers
   - Consider implications for more advanced learners

3. **Year 1 Student Characteristics**
   - 50% in first year may show:
     - Greater openness to new technologies
     - Less established writing habits
     - Potentially less confidence in English creative writing
   - May need additional support and encouragement

### 3.3 Statistical Considerations

- **Quantitative Analysis:** Sample size (N=20) provides limited statistical power for complex multivariate analyses
- **Recommended Approaches:**
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Non-parametric tests
  - Qualitative thematic analysis
  - Mixed-methods triangulation
  - Case study approaches

## 4. Demographic Diversity

### 4.1 Naming Patterns (Indicative of Cultural Background)
- Chinese/Hong Kong names: ~6 participants
- South Asian names (likely Nepal/India/Pakistan): ~10 participants
- Vietnamese name: 1 participant
- Other Asian backgrounds: ~3 participants

**Note:** Diverse L1 backgrounds provide rich context for studying L2 poetry writing with AI assistance across different linguistic and cultural frameworks.

## 5. Recommendations

### 5.1 For Data Collection Phase
1. Ensure consistent scaffolding across all experience levels
2. Monitor for potential Year 1 vs. upper-year differences
3. Leverage high English proficiency for complex creative tasks
4. Consider pairing/grouping strategies if collaborative elements introduced

### 5.2 For Analysis Phase
1. Report detailed descriptive statistics given sample size
2. Consider subgroup analysis (Year 1 vs. others; No experience vs. Beginner)
3. Use qualitative methods to capture nuanced learning experiences
4. Triangulate multiple data sources for robust findings

### 5.3 For Future Studies
1. Consider recruiting more experienced poets for comparison
2. Explore longitudinal development of novice poets using AI
3. Investigate differential effects across proficiency levels (though current sample limits this)

---

## 6. Summary

This participant sample represents a well-defined cohort of L2 English learners with strong linguistic proficiency but limited poetry writing experience. The predominance of first-year students and novice poets makes this sample particularly appropriate for investigating:

- Initial encounters with AI-assisted creative writing
- Learning trajectories of poetry novices
- Scaffolding strategies for L2 poetry development
- Attitudes toward AI in early stages of creative writing education

The sample's homogeneity in poetry experience, combined with diversity in cultural backgrounds and high English proficiency, provides an ideal context for exploring how AI tools can support novice L2 poets in developing their creative writing skills.
