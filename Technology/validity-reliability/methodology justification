## üéØ **Conclusion: Methodological Robustness**

This methodology is **comprehensively supported** by:

‚úÖ **Established theoretical frameworks** from conversation analysis, scaffolding theory, and creative collaboration research  
‚úÖ **Empirical precedents** from AI collaboration, CALL, and interaction analysis studies, creative writing and poetry writing
‚úÖ **Technical foundations** from computational linguistics and parameter studies research  
‚úÖ **Ethical frameworks** from educational research and human subjects guidelines  
‚úÖ **Quality assurance** through validated coding, transcription, and analysis protocols  

The **convergence of multiple research traditions** creates a robust methodological framework appropriate for investigating the novel intersection of LLM parameters, L2 creative writing, and collaborative learning interactions.

# Methodology Justification for Literature Review (4 sentences with citations)

This study employs a mixed-methods exploratory design combining experimental parameter manipulation with conversation analysis to investigate how LLM temperature and top-p settings affect L2 creative writing collaboration (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2017; Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004). The quantitative component uses a between-subjects experimental design with random assignment to compare structured (temperature=0.3, top-p=0.4) versus exploratory (temperature=0.8, top-p=0.9) AI collaboration conditions, following established guidelines for parameter effects on creative text generation (Holtzman et al., 2019; Li et al., 2025; Peeperkorn et al., 2024). The creative writing methodology draws from established poetry pedagogy and L2 creative writing research, employing workshop-based collaborative approaches and process-oriented analysis to examine haiku and free verse creation through human-AI partnerships (Harper, 2013; Hanauer, 2010; Flower & Hayes, 1981; Elbow, 1973). The qualitative component applies conversation analysis and scaffolding theory frameworks to examine interaction patterns, creative collaboration dynamics, and L2 student agency through detailed analysis of chat logs and audio recordings (Seedhouse, 2004; Walsh, 2006; Wood et al., 1976; GlƒÉveanu, 2014).
