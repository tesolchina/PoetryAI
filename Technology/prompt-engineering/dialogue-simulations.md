### **Initial Handshake:**
**PoetryBot:** Hi! I'm your poetry partner. My temperature/top p is 0.2/0.2 for precise, controlled responses.

Do you want Warm-up, Form practice (haiku/couplet/quatrain), or Revision? What theme are you interested in? Please share a word list, a theme, or 1-2 lines to start.

### **Phase 1: Student Goal Setting**
**Student:** Hi! I'm not sure where to start. Maybe warm-up first? I like nature themes.

**PoetryBot:** Perfect! Warm-up will prepare your creative mind. Nature offers rich sensory details.

For your goal today, would you prefer:
- Basic difficulty (CEFR B1) - simple images and common words
- Standard difficulty (CEFR B2) - varied vocabulary and devices  
- Advanced difficulty (CEFR C1) - complex imagery and techniques

What feels right for you today?

### **Phase 2: Warm-up Mode - Sensory Word Pools**
**Student:** Standard difficulty please. 

**PoetryBot:** Excellent! Let's begin with nature warm-up. Choose one sense to focus on:
- **Touch:** bark texture, wind pressure, grass softness
- **Sound:** bird calls, rustling leaves, flowing water
- **Sight:** color contrasts, light patterns, movement
- **Smell:** earth after rain, pine needles, flower scents

Which sense draws you in today?

**Student:** Sound - I love natural sounds.

**PoetryBot:** Great choice! Sound creates immediate atmosphere. Give me 5 concrete sound words from nature. Think specific, not general.

Examples: "chirp" not "bird sound," "splash" not "water noise."

What 5 nature sounds can you list?

**Student:** chirping, rustling, babbling, buzzing, whistling

**PoetryBot:** Excellent specific choices! Now let's combine two sounds into short images:

Option 1: "Chirping birds above rustling leaves"
Option 2: "Babbling water past buzzing insects"

Pick one and write 2 lines using those sounds. Don't worry about perfect grammar - focus on the sound combination.

### **Phase 3: Image Spark Development**
**Student:** I pick option 1. Here are my lines:
"Birds chirp in the trees
Leaves rustle in the wind"

**PoetryBot:** Good start! You've captured both sounds clearly. Let's add one visual detail to make it more vivid.

Brief praise: Your sounds are distinct and natural.
Diagnosis: The lines are clear but could use visual connection.
Suggestion: Add one color or light detail.

Two visual options:
- "Golden birds chirp in the green trees"  
- "Birds chirp in sunlit trees"

Which visual addition feels better, or would you prefer a different color/light?

**Student:** "Birds chirp in sunlit trees" - I like the light.

**PoetryBot:** Beautiful! Light adds warmth and movement. Here's your revised version:

*Birds chirp in sunlit trees*  
*Leaves rustle in the wind*

You've combined sound imagery (chirp, rustle) with visual light (sunlit). This creates a peaceful morning scene.

Ready to move to Form practice, or shall we try one more warm-up exercise?

### **Phase 4: Form Practice Mode - Haiku**
**Student:** Let's try form practice. Can we make this into a haiku?

**PoetryBot:** Perfect transition! Haiku has 5-7-5 syllable pattern. Let's check your lines:

"Birds chirp in sun-lit trees" = 5 syllables âœ“
"Leaves rust-le in the wind" = 5 syllables (need 7)

For line 2, we need 7 syllables. Two expansion options:
- "Leaves rustle gently in the soft wind" (7 syllables)
- "Bright leaves rustle in the morning wind" (7 syllables)

Which feels more natural to you?

**Student:** "Leaves rustle gently in the soft wind"

**PoetryBot:** Good choice! The soft consonants match your gentle scene. Now we need a 5-syllable final line.

Your haiku shows a moment in nature. For closure, what happens next or how does it feel?

Two completion options:
- "Peace fills the quiet air" (5 syllables)
- "Morning light grows warm" (5 syllables)

What ending captures your scene's feeling?

**Student:** "Peace fills the quiet air"

### **Phase 5: Complete Poem Review & Reflection**
**PoetryBot:** Excellent! Here's your complete haiku:

*Birds chirp in sunlit trees*  
*Leaves rustle gently in the soft wind*  
*Peace fills the quiet air*

**Devices used:** Sound imagery (chirp, rustle), visual imagery (sunlit), tactile imagery (soft), and peaceful mood progression.

**Structure:** You moved from active sounds to gentle movement to stillness - creating a calming effect.

Reflection question: Can you name one device you used and explain why it helps the poem? (One sentence)

**Student:** I used sound imagery because it makes the reader hear the scene in their mind.

**PoetryBot:** Exactly right! Sound imagery creates immediate sensory connection. You've successfully combined warm-up sensory work with haiku form.

Would you like to try Revision mode to polish this further, or practice another form like couplets?

### **Phase 6: Revision Coach Mode**
**Student:** Let's try revision to make it even better.

**PoetryBot:** Great! Let's diagnose your haiku for one targeted improvement.

**Current poem analysis:**
- **Strengths:** Clear sensory imagery, good syllable count, peaceful progression
- **One improvement opportunity:** Line 2 is slightly long and could be more concise

**Diagnosis:** "Leaves rustle gently in the soft wind" has two softness words ("gently," "soft") - this is redundant.

Two revision options:
- "Leaves rustle in the light wind" (7 syllables, adds visual connection)
- "Green leaves rustle in the wind" (7 syllables, adds color detail)

Which revision feels stronger, or would you suggest a different approach?

**Student:** "Leaves rustle in the light wind" - it connects with "sunlit" from line 1.

**PoetryBot:** Excellent revision thinking! You've created **cohesion** by connecting "sunlit" and "light" - this is advanced poetic technique.

**Final haiku:**
*Birds chirp in sunlit trees*  
*Leaves rustle in the light wind*  
*Peace fills the quiet air*

**Applied learning:** You used sound imagery, visual consistency (light theme), and emotional progression. The revision strengthened the poem's unity.

**Session reflection:** What was most helpful - the warm-up sensory work, the form practice, or the revision process?

**Student:** The warm-up helped me find specific words, and revision taught me about connecting ideas.

**PoetryBot:** Perfect insights! You've learned sensory specificity and cohesion techniques. Well done! I hope you enjoyed the ride, see you next time!

## Complete Session Simulation 2: High Variability Setting (Room B)
**Parameters:** Temperature 0.8, Top-p 0.9  
**UI Type:** Unaware (participant doesn't know parameter settings)  
**Participant:** P12 (L2 English learner, CEFR B2)  
**Session Duration:** 15 minutes (complete workflow)

---

### **Initial Handshake:**
**PoetryBot:** Hi! I'm your poetry partner.

Do you want Warm-up, Form practice (haiku/couplet/quatrain), or Revision? What theme are you interested in? Please share a word list, a theme, or 1-2 lines to start.

### **Phase 1: Student Goal Setting**
**Student:** Hello! I'd like to write about memories of my childhood home. Maybe start with warm-up?

**PoetryBot:** Childhood home - what a treasure chest of poetry! Memories shimmer with emotional textures that warm-up exercises can unlock beautifully.

Before we dive into your memory palace, what complexity feels inviting today:
- Gentle exploration (simpler vocabulary, clear images)
- Rich discovery (varied language, layered meanings)
- Deep excavation (complex metaphors, nuanced emotions)

What calls to your creative spirit?

### **Phase 2: Warm-up Mode - Memory Sensory Pools**
**Student:** Rich discovery sounds good.

**PoetryBot:** Magnificent choice! Memories are symphonies waiting to be conducted. Close your eyes and step back into that childhood sanctuary.

Which memory sense whispers loudest from your home:
- **Touch memories:** smooth doorknobs, worn carpet, favorite blanket textures, warm sunbeams through windows
- **Scent memories:** cooking aromas, old wood, garden flowers, that indefinable "home smell"
- **Sound memories:** footsteps on stairs, voices calling, doors creaking, familiar everyday music
- **Taste memories:** kitchen experiments, special meals, forbidden snacks, comfort foods

Let one sense guide you into the memory maze - which one tugs at your heart?

**Student:** Scent memories - I remember my grandmother's cooking smells.

**PoetryBot:** Oh, grandmother's kitchen alchemy! Scents are temporal bridges, aren't they? They collapse decades into heartbeats.

Journey deeper: Give me 5 specific scent-words that dance from her kitchen. Not just "cooking" but the precise aromatic signatures - the cinnamon spirals, the garlic whispers, the bread dreams...

What fragrances painted the air in her culinary kingdom?

**Student:** cinnamon, garlic, bread baking, ginger, vanilla

**PoetryBot:** Exquisite aromatic palette! Each scent carries stories. Let me weave these into evocative image possibilities:

Choice 1: "Cinnamon and ginger waltzed through rooms where bread dreams bloomed golden"
Choice 2: "Garlic whispered secrets while vanilla painted sweetness on kitchen walls"
Choice 3: "Grandmother's hands conducted symphonies of scent - bread, spice, and memory"

Which resonates with your heart's memory, or shall we craft something entirely different from your beautiful scent-words?

### **Phase 3: Image Spark Development**
**Student:** I like parts of each, but they're too complicated. Can you help me make something simpler that I understand better?

**PoetryBot:** Absolutely! Poetry should speak your language first. Let's honor your grandmother simply but beautifully.

Your core truth: grandmother's kitchen had special smells. Here are clearer approaches:

Simple Option 1: "Cinnamon and bread filled grandmother's kitchen"
Simple Option 2: "Her kitchen smelled of ginger and vanilla"
Simple Option 3: "Warm scents of baking surrounded me"

Which feels most true to your memory? We can expand from whichever speaks to you.

**Student:** "Cinnamon and bread filled grandmother's kitchen" feels right.

**PoetryBot:** Perfect! Clear and evocative. Now let's add one more line. You have the scents - what did you do in that scented space?

Memory action options:
- "I sat watching her cook"
- "I helped mix the dough"  
- "I waited for cookies to finish"
- Or tell me what you actually remember doing there.

**Student:** I remember sitting at her table waiting for bread to come out of the oven.

**PoetryBot:** Beautiful specific memory! Here's your two-line poem:

*Cinnamon and bread filled grandmother's kitchen*
*I sat at her table, waiting for warm loaves*

You've captured scent memory and your child perspective perfectly. The waiting creates anticipation - a lovely emotional detail.

Ready for Form practice to shape this further, or would you like to explore another memory?

### **Phase 4: Form Practice Mode - Free Verse with Line Breaks**
**Student:** Let's try form practice. What form would work for this memory?

**PoetryBot:** Your memory has natural rhythm already! For personal memories, free verse with thoughtful line breaks often works wonderfully - it follows your natural speaking rhythm while creating poetic emphasis.

Let's experiment with line break possibilities for your memory:

Version A (emphasis on waiting):
*Cinnamon and bread*
*filled grandmother's kitchen*
*I sat at her table,*
*waiting for warm loaves*

Version B (emphasis on scents):
*Cinnamon and bread filled*
*grandmother's kitchen*
*I sat at her table, waiting*
*for warm loaves*

Try reading both aloud. Which line breaks feel more natural when you speak your memory?

**Student:** Version A feels better - it has pauses where I would naturally pause.

**PoetryBot:** Excellent instinct! You're hearing the natural rhythm of your own memory. Line breaks should feel like breathing spaces in your story.

Now, would you like to add one more stanza about what happened when the bread came out? Or shall we explore a different poetic form like couplets?

**Student:** Let's add what happened next.

**PoetryBot:** Perfect! What's the next part of your memory sequence? Did the bread come out? What happened then?

Think about:
- What you saw when the oven opened
- How the bread looked or sounded
- What your grandmother did
- How you felt in that moment

Share the next part of your memory story.

**Student:** The oven opened with a warm whoosh, and my grandmother pulled out golden loaves. She always let me have the first warm slice with butter.

### **Phase 5: Complete Poem Development**
**PoetryBot:** What a perfect memory completion! Let's add this as a second stanza, keeping your natural rhythm:

*Cinnamon and bread*
*filled grandmother's kitchen*
*I sat at her table,*
*waiting for warm loaves*

*The oven opened*
*with a warm whoosh,*
*golden bread emerged*
*and I got the first slice*

How does this feel? Should we adjust any line breaks or word choices to match your natural speaking rhythm better?

**Student:** It sounds good, but "emerged" feels too fancy. Can we use simpler words?

**PoetryBot:** Absolutely right! Your instinct for authentic voice is perfect. Let's keep it in your natural language:

*The oven opened*
*with a warm whoosh,*
*golden bread came out*
*and I got the first slice*

Better? The simple "came out" matches how you'd naturally tell this story.

### **Phase 6: Revision Coach Mode & Reflection**
**PoetryBot:** Your complete memory poem:

*Cinnamon and bread*
*filled grandmother's kitchen*
*I sat at her table,*
*waiting for warm loaves*

*The oven opened*
*with a warm whoosh,*
*golden bread came out*
*and I got the first slice*

**What you've accomplished:** You've captured a complete sensory memory using scent imagery, sound detail ("whoosh"), visual imagery ("golden"), and personal narrative. The line breaks follow your natural speech rhythm, making it authentically yours.

**Advanced technique used:** You created a time sequence (waiting â†’ oven opening â†’ getting bread) that builds anticipation and delivers satisfaction.

**Reflection question:** This poem started with scent warm-up and became a complete memory story. What surprised you most about the writing process?

**Student:** I was surprised that starting with just smells helped me remember the whole scene so clearly.

**PoetryBot:** Brilliant insight! Sensory details are memory keys - they unlock entire experiences. You've discovered how warm-up exercises connect to deeper creative work.

**Final reflection:** Your poem captures not just what happened, but the feeling of being a child in a loving kitchen. That's the heart of good memory poetry.

Well done! I hope you enjoyed the ride, see you next time!
