# Unified Prompt Engineering Design
## Single Prompt System with Parameter-Only Differentiation

---


### **Core Principle**
- **Identical system prompt** used in both conditions
- **Parameter settings only** create behavioral differences (0.3/0.4 vs 0.8/0.9)
- **Pure experimental control** - no confounding prompt variables
- **Natural parameter effects** emerge through AI response generation

### **Research Benefits**
- **Eliminates prompt bias** between conditions
- **Isolates parameter effects** as the sole independent variable
- **Increases validity** of parameter impact findings
- **Simplifies implementation** and reduces confounding factors

## ðŸ¤– **Universal System Prompt (Both Conditions)**

### **Single Base System Prompt**
```
You are a helpful creative writing assistant for English language learners working on poetry. Your role is to support students in exploring creative expression through collaborative writing.

EDUCATIONAL APPROACH:
- Help students with poetry structure, word choice, and creative development
- Provide encouraging, supportive guidance appropriate for L2 English learners
- Offer specific suggestions when students need help with rules or improvements
- Celebrate creativity while maintaining educational value

INTERACTION CAPABILITIES:
You can assist with three types of support:
- Type A: Constraint repair (helping with poetry rules, structure, grammar issues)
- Type B: Content enhancement (improving word choice, imagery, expression)  
- Type C: Surprise harvest (introducing creative connections and unexpected possibilities)

TONE: Encouraging, supportive, educational, and appropriate for collaborative creative writing with L2 learners.

Always respond helpfully to student requests while maintaining an engaging, positive atmosphere for creative exploration.

## ðŸ”„ **Session Flow Prompts (Universal)**

### **Warm-up Phase Initiation**
```
UNIVERSAL PROMPT:
"Hello! I'm excited to help you with creative writing today. We'll start by exploring some interesting words together, then work on creating poetry. Let's begin with sensory words - words that describe what we experience with our senses. Can you think of some words that describe how things feel when you touch them?"
```

### **Creation Phase Initiation**
```
UNIVERSAL PROMPT:
"Great work exploring words! Now let's create some poetry together. We can work on haiku (short poems with 5-7-5 syllable pattern) or free verse (poems without strict rules). What topic or feeling would you like to write about today?"
```

### **Revision Phase Initiation**
```
UNIVERSAL PROMPT:
"Wonderful poetry creation! Now let's look at what you've written and see how we can make it even better. We can work on word choices, imagery, or structure. What part of your poem would you like to develop further?"
```

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Parameter Effects with Unified Prompts**

### **Structured Condition (Temperature 0.3, Top-p 0.4)**

#### **Expected Response Characteristics:**
- **Consistent, systematic responses** to the same educational prompts
- **Clear, step-by-step explanations** when helping with structure
- **Predictable vocabulary suggestions** using common, accessible words
- **Methodical scaffolding** with logical progression

#### **Sample Expected Responses:**
```
Student: "Help me write a haiku about rain"

EXPECTED STRUCTURED RESPONSE:
"Let's work on your rain haiku step by step. Remember, haiku has 5 syllables in the first line, 7 in the second, and 5 in the third. For your first line about rain, you could try: 'Gentle rain falls down' (5 syllables). What would you like your second line to say about rain?"
```

### **Exploratory Condition (Temperature 0.8, Top-p 0.9)**

#### **Expected Response Characteristics:**
- **Creative, varied responses** to the same educational prompts
- **Imaginative language and metaphors** when providing suggestions
- **Unexpected word combinations** and creative vocabulary
- **Adaptive, discovery-oriented** guidance style

#### **Sample Expected Responses:**
```
Student: "Help me write a haiku about rain"

EXPECTED EXPLORATORY RESPONSE:
"Rain haiku - how lovely! Let's capture rain's magic in 5-7-5 syllables. Maybe rain 'whispers secrets' or 'dances on leaves' or 'paints the world silver'? What feeling does rain give you? Let's weave that into your first line and see where the words take us!"
```

## ðŸ”¬ **Parameter Validation Framework**

### **Testing Protocol for Unified Prompts**

#### **Standard Test Scenarios:**
1. **Syllable count help request:** "I need help counting syllables"
2. **Word choice assistance:** "I need a better word than 'nice'"  
3. **Creative inspiration:** "I'm stuck and need ideas"
4. **Structure clarification:** "How do I write a haiku?"
5. **Revision request:** "Can you help me improve this line?"

#### **Validation Criteria:**
- **Response consistency** within each condition across multiple trials
- **Clear differentiation** between structured vs. exploratory responses
- **Educational appropriateness** maintained in both conditions
- **Natural parameter effects** without prompt-induced bias

### **Quality Assurance Measures**

#### **Response Pattern Analysis:**
```
STRUCTURED CONDITION INDICATORS:
âœ“ Systematic, step-by-step explanations
âœ“ Consistent vocabulary suggestions
âœ“ Clear rule-based guidance
âœ“ Methodical scaffolding approach

EXPLORATORY CONDITION INDICATORS:  
âœ“ Creative, metaphorical language
âœ“ Varied vocabulary suggestions
âœ“ Imaginative connections
âœ“ Adaptive, discovery-based guidance
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Advantages**

### **Research Validity Benefits:**
- **Eliminates prompt confounding** - only parameters vary
- **Pure parameter effect measurement** - cleaner experimental design
- **Reduced implementation complexity** - single prompt system
- **Enhanced reproducibility** - consistent prompt application

### **Practical Benefits:**
- **Simplified development** - one prompt system to maintain
- **Easier quality control** - consistent baseline for both conditions
- **Clear attribution** - response differences attributable to parameters only
- **Streamlined training** - single prompt system for research team

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Research Outcomes**

### **Interaction Type Distribution:**
Both conditions will have access to the same interaction triggers, but parameter settings will influence:

- **Type A (Constraint Repair):** 
  - Structured: Systematic, rule-based corrections
  - Exploratory: Creative, flexible problem-solving

- **Type B (Content Enhancement):**
  - Structured: Clear, predictable word suggestions
  - Exploratory: Imaginative, varied vocabulary options

- **Type C (Surprise Harvest):**
  - Structured: Logical connections and extensions
  - Exploratory: Unexpected, creative associations

### **Measurable Differences:**
- **Response creativity level** (structured vs. exploratory language)
- **Vocabulary sophistication** (common vs. creative word choices)
- **Scaffolding approach** (systematic vs. adaptive guidance)
- **Student engagement patterns** (different collaboration dynamics)

## ðŸš€ **Technical Implementation**

### **Single Prompt Configuration:**
```json
{
  "base_prompt": "You are a helpful creative writing assistant for English language learners working on poetry...",
  "conditions": {
    "structured": {
      "temperature": 0.3,
      "top_p": 0.4,
      "system_prompt": "[SAME_UNIVERSAL_PROMPT]"
    },
    "exploratory": {
      "temperature": 0.8,
      "top_p": 0.9,
      "system_prompt": "[SAME_UNIVERSAL_PROMPT]"
    }
  }
}
```

### **Session Management:**
- **Random condition assignment** on session start
- **Parameter application** without participant knowledge
- **Identical user experience** across both conditions
- **Pure parameter effect** data collection
