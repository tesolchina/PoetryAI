**(1) Set up: **how best for Ruobin to establish the data collection stations (in class?) on which days, for how many students (=n)  is most credible, and how to incentivize student participation fairly and appropriately?

*Perceived risk: *I'm concerned that if Ruobin samples across several classes or different student user types, her data findings will become randomized and less convincing.

**(2) project design (sequence): **Is the sequence she is proposing (student preparation briefing----> student user interactions logged via chatbotâ€”---> post-experiment survey and user group discussion) basically fit for the purpose of adequate gathering and interpetation to meet a credible standard?

*Perceived risk: *I lack sufficient expertise to benchmark Ruobin proposed project design to existing best practices and methodology.

 **(3) Student user sample (non-probability sampling)** : individual users of the chatbot and follow-on group interactions (survey data). Is Ruobin selecting  her student cohort sample simply via convenience (accessible) or purposively (meeting specific criteria for selection)? What are these criteria?

 *Perceived risk* : I'm concerned that: (a) the students may not be clear as to why they have been chosen; and (b) that the back-end group survey could simply become a subjective "cliff" with only  unverifiable opinions delivered (data findings hard to measure or generalize from)

**(4) Control group: **I've suggested that Ruobin use a control group (i.e. users whose top-P settings are **zero** but who are unaware of that) to establish a baseline for interpretation.

*Perceived risk: *without a control group, the project cannot make data-backed comparisons across different student user groups at different  (high, medium, low)

 **(5) The prompts she's using** : based on your experience, are these prompts she's made adequately tailored to meet the data integrity requirements for effective analysis?

 *Perceived risk: * "garbage in means garbage out" (if the prompts are insufficiently tailored, then the data outputs do not meet the project requirements)
