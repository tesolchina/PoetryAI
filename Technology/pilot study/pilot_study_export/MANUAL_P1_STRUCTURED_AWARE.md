## 4. TUTORIAL SCRIPT FOR P1 (⚠️ AWARE CONDITION)

> **"Great! Now let me show you how the platform works."**
>
> [Log P1 in using their phone number: ________________]
>
> [Navigate to: `room_1_structured_aware`]
>
> **"This is your workspace. It's like a chat interface. You'll have a conversation with your AI poetry partner."**
>
> **[Point to message area]**  
> **"This is where messages appear. You'll see what the AI says here."**
>
> **[Point to input box]**  
> **"You type your responses down here. Just like texting."**
>
> **[Point to send button]**

>
> ### ⚠️ CRITICAL FOR P1 - PARAMETER AWARENESS SECTION
>
> **[Point to parameter display section]**
>
> **"Now, you'll notice this section here shows some technical information about your AI partner."**
>
> **[Read what's visible on screen]**  
> **"It shows things like 'Temperature: 0.25' and 'Style: Structured.' This tells you how the AI is configured to work with you."**
>
> **"In your case, you have a 'Structured' AI partner with lower temperature settings. This means it will tend to give more consistent, methodical guidance—less random creativity, more focused on form and structure."**
>
> **"If you're curious about what these settings mean or how they affect the collaboration, feel free to ask the AI about it during your session. That's totally fine and actually interesting for our research."**
>
> **"Some people find this information helpful for understanding their AI partner, others ignore it. Either way is completely okay."**
>
> ### Back to General Instructions
>
> **"I'll be sitting nearby taking some notes for research purposes, but I won't interrupt you. This is your creative time with the AI."**
>
> **"If you encounter any technical problems—like the screen freezes or something doesn't work—let me know and I'll help. Otherwise, I'll just be observing quietly."**
>
> **"You'll have about 25 minutes to write. I'll let you know when we have about 5 minutes left."**
>
> **"Do you have any questions about how to use the platform?"**
>
> [Answer questions]
>
> ****"Alright, the session timer is started. Take a deep breath, relax, and have fun creating! There's no pressure."**

## 8. P1-SPECIFIC TROUBLESHOOTING

### If P1 asks about parameter meanings:

> **"Great question! Temperature controls how predictable the AI's responses are. Lower numbers like yours (0.25) make it more focused and consistent. Higher numbers make it more creative and varied."**
>
> **"'Top-P' is similar—it controls the diversity of word choices. Your settings are configured for more structured, methodical collaboration."**
>
> **"Feel free to ask your AI partner about this during your session—it can explain too!"**

### If P1 can't see parameter display:

- **CRITICAL ERROR** - Wrong room loaded
- Immediately check URL
- Should be: `room_1_structured_aware`
- If wrong, apologize and navigate to correct room
- Restart tutorial
- Document this deviation

### If P1 seems bored by structured approach:

- **Don't intervene** unless they express frustration
- In interview, probe: "Did the AI's style work for you?"
- This is valuable data about structured vs. exploratory preferences
- Let their authentic reaction emerge

---

## 9. P1 COMPLETION CHECKLIST

After P1's session, confirm:
- [ ] All P1 forms labeled and filed
- [ ] P1 audio recording saved and backed up

- [ ] P1 session summary completed
- [ ] P1 data backed up to 3 locations
- [ ] Notes transferred to digital format

---

## COMPARISON NOTES (For Analysis Phase)

**P1 (Structured-Aware) will be compared with:**

- **P2 (Structured-Unaware)**: Same AI style, but P2 doesn't see settings
  - *Analysis question*: Does awareness of structure affect experience?

- **P3 (Exploratory-Aware)**: Both aware, different AI styles
  - *Analysis question*: How do reactions differ to structure vs. exploration?

- **P4 (Exploratory-Unaware)**: Opposite condition (exploratory + unaware)
  - *Analysis question*: Maximum difference—what patterns emerge?
