## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't:

1. **Skip the preparation**
   - Testing platform the day before → technical disasters
   - Skipping practice sessions → awkward facilitation
   - Forgetting materials → unprofessional, incomplete data

2. **Bias the participants**
   - Commenting on their poems → influences their process
   - Suggesting "better" ways → skews data
   - Showing frustration → makes them uncomfortable

3. **Neglect data management**
   - Waiting to export data → risk of loss
   - Not labeling files → confusion later
   - Single backup location → data loss disaster

4. **Rush the process**
   - Cutting sessions short → incomplete data
   - Quick interviews → shallow insights
   - Rushing analysis → missed patterns

5. **Ignore deviations**
   - Technical issues not documented → can't interpret data
   - Protocol changes not noted → inconsistency issues
   - Participant concerns not addressed → ethical problems
