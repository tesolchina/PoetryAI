## 8. P2-SPECIFIC TROUBLESHOOTING

### If P2 asks about how AI works:

> **"The AI analyzes what you write and generates responses based on patterns it's learned. It's designed specifically to help with creative writing."**
>
> **[Keep it general—don't mention parameters]**
>
> **"Does it feel like it's understanding you so far?"**

### If P2 sees parameter display (CRITICAL ERROR):

- **WRONG ROOM LOADED**
- Check URL immediately
- Should be: `room_2_structured_unaware`
- If wrong, apologize: "Sorry, let me get you to the right workspace"
- Navigate to correct room
- Restart tutorial
- Document this deviation
- Note if P2 saw any parameter info

### If P2 wants more technical details:

> **"Great question! After the session during our debrief, I'll explain more about how the AI was configured. For now, just interact with it naturally and see how it feels. Your authentic experience is what's valuable for our research."**
