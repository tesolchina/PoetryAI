## 7. Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Participant Can't Log In

**Symptoms:** Phone number not accepted, verification code not received

**Solutions:**
1. Check phone number format (include country code +1 for US)
2. Resend verification code (wait 30 seconds between attempts)
3. Use test/demo account if available
4. Check Supabase authentication status
5. Last resort: Use your test account, note this deviation

**Prevention:** Test login process 1 hour before session

---

### Scenario 2: AI Not Responding

**Symptoms:** Message sent but no AI response after >30 seconds

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Refresh the page (may lose current message—apologize)
3. Check OpenRouter API status at https://openrouter.ai/status
4. Verify API key has sufficient credits
5. Switch to backup API key if available
6. If persistent, reschedule session

**What to tell participant:**
> "I apologize—we're experiencing a technical delay. Let me check the connection... [fix attempt]. This shouldn't take long."

**Prevention:** Check API status and credit balance before each session

---

### Scenario 3: Wrong Room Loaded

**Symptoms:** Participant in wrong condition (e.g., P1 sees P2's room)

**Solutions:**
1. Immediately end session
2. Navigate to correct room URL
3. Restart session
4. Apologize briefly, don't elaborate on conditions
5. Note this deviation for data analysis

**Prevention:** Double-check room URL before inviting participant to start

---

### Scenario 4: Participant Very Frustrated/Wants to Quit

**Symptoms:** Verbal frustration, body language shows distress, asks to stop

**Solutions:**
1. Acknowledge feelings: "I can see this is frustrating. That's completely understandable."
2. Remind them they can stop anytime: "You're welcome to end the session if you'd like. There's no penalty."
3. Offer options: "Would you like to take a short break? Or try a different approach?"
4. If they want to quit: Thank them, conduct brief exit interview (why frustrated), provide compensation anyway
5. Document incident thoroughly

**Prevention:** Set realistic expectations, emphasize no pressure, check in if body language shows distress

---

### Scenario 5: Participant Asks About AI's "Intelligence"

**Symptoms:** "Is the AI really understanding me?" "Is this a real AI?"

**For Aware Conditions (P1, P3):**
> "That's a great question! The AI uses the parameter settings you can see here. It analyzes your input and generates responses based on those configurations. Would you like to know more about how it works?"

**For Unaware Conditions (P2, P4):**
> "The AI analyzes what you write and generates responses based on patterns it's learned. It's designed to help with creative writing specifically. Does it feel like it's understanding you so far?"

**Follow-up probe:**
> "What made you curious about that?"

---

### Scenario 6: Participant Completes Task Very Quickly (<15 minutes)

**Symptoms:** Finishes one poem in 12 minutes, seems done

**Solutions:**
1. Praise their work: "That's great! You created a complete poem."
2. Encourage exploration: "You still have time. Would you like to try a different poetry form? Or create another poem?"
3. Suggest variation: "Some people like to experiment with different styles. Feel free to explore."
4. If they insist they're done: Proceed to interview, note short duration

**Prevention:** In tutorial, mention "exploring multiple forms" as an option

---

### Scenario 7: Platform Crashes Mid-Session

**Symptoms:** Browser freeze, error message, lost connection

**Solutions:**
1. Stay calm: "We've had a technical issue. Let me fix this quickly."
2. Refresh page or restart browser
3. Log participant back in
4. Navigate to their room
5. Check if data was saved (might be in database)
6. Apologize and explain they'll continue from checkpoint or restart
7. Add time to compensate for interruption
8. Document crash details for IT follow-up

**Prevention:** Close unnecessary browser tabs, ensure stable internet

---

### Scenario 8: Participant Shares Sensitive Personal Information

**Symptoms:** Reveals trauma, mental health struggles, illegal activity in poetry

**Immediate response:**
> "Thank you for sharing that. I want to remind you that our conversation is confidential, but if you're experiencing [crisis], there are resources available."

**For mental health concerns:**
> "If you're struggling, I can provide contact information for [campus counseling / crisis hotline]."

**Document:** Note this occurred, but don't record specific content unless necessary

**Ethics:** If participant discloses harm to self/others, follow institutional mandatory reporting guidelines

---

## 8. FAQ & Best Practices

### Frequently Asked Questions (From Facilitators)

**Q: What if the participant asks which condition they're in?**

**A (During session):** "We have a few different configurations for this study. After the session, I'll explain the different conditions and which one you were in."

**A (After session in debrief):** Explain fully—they were in one of 4 conditions, describe the 2x2 design briefly.

---

**Q: Can I compliment their poem?**

**A:** Be cautious. You can express general positivity ("I can see you put thought into that" / "Interesting approach") but avoid specific content praise ("That's a beautiful metaphor"). Focus on their experience, not poem quality.

Safe: "It's great that you completed a whole poem!"
Risky: "Wow, that's really profound."

---

**Q: What if they ask me to help with a rhyme or word choice?**

**A:** Redirect to AI: "The AI is designed to help with that—try asking it for suggestions!" Don't provide creative input yourself.

---

**Q: Should I read their poems?**

**A:** You'll see them while observing, which is fine. Don't comment in detail during session. In interview, you can reference general aspects ("I noticed you tried multiple forms") but don't critique content.

---

**Q: What if two participants know each other?**

**A:** Schedule them on different days if possible. Emphasize not sharing details with each other until after the second person completes their session. This maintains independence of responses.

---

**Q: How do I handle a very chatty participant who wants to talk before/after?**

**A:** Be friendly but time-conscious. During welcome, briefly engage then transition: "I love hearing that—let's make sure we have enough time for the poetry session." After, you can chat briefly while they leave, but stick to schedule for next participant.

---

**Q: What if technical issues take up most of the session time?**

**A:** 
- If >15 minutes lost to tech: Offer to reschedule or extend session (if your schedule allows)
- If minor delays (<5 min): Continue, compensate slightly less time if needed
- Always document and consider excluding that participant's data if issues were severe

---

### Best Practices for Facilitators

#### Building Rapport Without Bias

✅ **Do:**
- Smile and be welcoming
- Use participant's name
- Express gratitude for participation
- Maintain neutral body language
- Listen actively in interview

❌ **Don't:**
- Express opinions about AI
- Share your own poetry
- Judge their writing ability
- Show favoritism toward certain forms
- Hint at "better" ways to interact

---

#### Managing Time Effectively

**5-Minute Warning:**
> "Just letting you know we have about 5 minutes left for writing. Feel free to wrap up what you're working on."

**Hard Stop at 27-28 minutes:**
> "Let's pause here for today. Thank you for your creativity!"

**If interview running long (>12 minutes):**
- Politely wrap up: "These are wonderful insights. I want to be respectful of your time—just one or two more quick questions..."
- Skip less critical questions
- Cover essential: experience, challenges, would-use-again

---

#### Effective Observation

**What to observe:**
- Changes in engagement (leans in vs. leans back)
- Typing patterns (fluent vs. stops-and-starts)
- Facial reactions to AI responses
- Time spent on different phases (selecting form, writing, revising)
- Number of messages exchanged

**How to observe:**
- Position yourself slightly behind and to the side (not directly over shoulder)
- Keep observation notes minimal during session (expand after)
- Use abbreviations and shorthand
- Focus on behaviors, not content interpretation

**Observation shorthand examples:**
- "T+" = typing fluently
- "T-" = stopped typing, paused
- "L@S" = looking at screen intently
- "LB" = leaning back
- "FR→" = facial reaction (smile, frown, etc.)

---

#### Handling Unexpected Situations

**Participant brings a friend:**
- Politely explain study is individual
- Offer friend a comfortable waiting area
- Ensure they can't overhear session

**Participant is late:**
- Greet warmly without showing frustration
- Assess if there's time for full session
- May need to slightly abbreviate (shorten interview by 2-3 min)

**Participant arrives early:**
- Greet and offer water
- Let them know you'll start at scheduled time
- Use time to review materials while they wait

**You make a mistake (read wrong script, wrong room, etc.):**
- Correct immediately and professionally
- Apologize briefly: "My apologies, let me correct that..."
- Document the deviation
- Don't dwell on it or make participant uncomfortable

---

#### Maintaining Research Integrity

**Consistency across participants:**
- Use same scripts (adapted for condition)
- Same session duration (±2 minutes acceptable)
- Same environment setup
- Same interview questions (order can vary naturally)

**Avoiding experimenter bias:**
- Don't hint at "correct" ways to interact
- Don't express preferences for certain forms
- Don't let your own reactions influence participant
- Stay neutral even if you find their approach interesting/unusual

**Documentation discipline:**
- Complete all forms for each participant
- Don't skip observation notes due to fatigue
- Back up data immediately (don't accumulate)
- Review notes while memory is fresh

---

#### Self-Care for Facilitators

**Conducting 4 sessions in 4 days can be intensive:**

- Build in breaks between sessions (minimum 1 hour)
- Stay hydrated and eat properly
- Review your notes each day to avoid mixing up participants
- Debrief with colleague or PI if you have concerns
- Celebrate progress—each completed session is an achievement!

**Recognize signs of facilitator fatigue:**
- Forgetting steps in protocol
- Less patience with participants
- Sloppy note-taking
- Less enthusiasm in voice

**If fatigued:** Take a longer break, review materials, refocus on research goals

---

#### Communication with Participants

**Email templates available in:** `/PilotData/CommunicationTemplates/`

**Pre-session reminder (send 24 hours before):**
- Confirm date/time/location
- Remind about duration (~60 min)
- Mention compensation
- Ask to arrive 5 minutes early

**Thank-you follow-up (send within 48 hours):**
- Express gratitude
- Remind them they'll receive findings summary if requested
- Provide contact for any questions
- Emphasize confidentiality maintained
