# Quick Reference: 2-Participant Backup Plan
## At-a-Glance Guide for Facilitators

**Use this plan when:** You can only recruit 2 participants instead of 4

---

## 📊 Participant Assignment

| ID | Room | AI Style | Temp | Top-P | Awareness | What to Test |
|----|------|----------|------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **P1** | `room_1_structured_unaware` | Structured | 0.25 | 0.35 | Unaware | Consistent guidance |
| **P2** | `room_2_exploratory_unaware` | Exploratory | 0.80 | 0.90 | Unaware | Creative variety |

**Focus:** Parameter comparison (structured vs exploratory)  
**Held constant:** Awareness (both unaware)

---

## ⏱️ Timeline (2-3 Weeks)

### Week 1: Preparation
- **Day 1:** Recruit 2 participants, schedule sessions
- **Day 2:** Test both rooms, prepare materials

### Week 2: Data Collection

**Day 1 - Session 1 (Both participants, same day OK):**
- 9:00-9:10 AM: P1 Session 1 (Login)
- 9:30-9:40 AM: P2 Session 1 (Login)

**Day 2 - P1 Session 2:**
- 10:00-10:25 AM: P1 Poetry Writing (Room 1)

**Day 3 - P2 Session 2:**
- 10:00-10:25 AM: P2 Poetry Writing (Room 2)

*Gap allows fixes between participants*

### Week 3: Analysis
- Data extraction, analysis, report writing

---

## ✅ Session Checklist

### SESSION 1 (10 min each)
- [ ] Welcome & consent (3 min)
- [ ] Questionnaire (3 min)
- [ ] Login test (3 min)
- [ ] Schedule Session 2 (1 min)

**Can run both P1 & P2 same day!**

---

### SESSION 2 (25 min each)
- [ ] Welcome & login (2 min)
- [ ] Tutorial (2 min)
- [ ] **Poetry writing** (15 min) - OBSERVE!
- [ ] **Extended interview** (10 min) - RECORD!
- [ ] Debrief & incentive (1 min)

**Run on different days (allows fixes)**

---

## 🎤 Enhanced Interview (10 Minutes)

### Core Questions (5 min):
1. Experience overview
2. What worked / didn't work
3. AI help vs hindrance
4. Would you use again?

### Deep Dive (5 min):
5. Specific moment that stood out
6. Compare to solo writing
7. One thing to change
8. Did AI "get" your vision?
9. Who would benefit most?
10. Technical issues?

**Go deeper with only 2 participants!**

---

## 📋 Materials Needed (×2)

- [ ] Consent forms (2 + extras)
- [ ] Pre-questionnaires (2)
- [ ] Interview guides (2)
- [ ] Observation sheets (2)
- [ ] Recording device
- [ ] $25 incentives (×2)

**Budget: $70 total**

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Must Have:
✅ Both participants complete without major crashes  
✅ Data logs successfully  
✅ Both rooms function as designed  
✅ Identify ≥3 system improvements  

### Nice to Have:
✅ Clear differences observed between conditions  
✅ Rich qualitative feedback  
✅ Positive participant experience  
✅ At least 1 poem per participant  

---

## 📊 Analysis Focus

### Quantitative (Descriptive Only):
- Create comparison tables
- **Do NOT test significance** (N=2 insufficient)
- Report as observations, not findings

Example: "P1 sent 23 messages vs P2's 31, suggesting [observation]"

### Qualitative (Primary Focus):
- Thematic coding of interviews
- Conversation analysis
- Poetry output comparison
- Detailed observational notes

**Go deep, not broad!**

---

## 🔍 What to Watch For

### P1 (Structured AI):
- Consistency of AI responses
- User comfort with predictability
- Effectiveness of rule-based guidance
- Creative constraint vs support

### P2 (Exploratory AI):
- Variety of AI suggestions
- User reaction to surprises
- Navigation of multiple options
- Creative inspiration vs confusion

### Both:
- Usability issues
- Technical glitches
- Engagement level
- Completion success

---

## ⚠️ Key Differences from 4-Participant Plan

### What's the Same:
- Two-session structure
- Session protocols
- Data collection methods
- Room configurations

### What's Different:
- **Sample:** 2 instead of 4
- **Focus:** Technical validation > hypothesis testing
- **Conditions:** Only structured vs exploratory (not 2×2)
- **Analysis:** Qualitative comparison (no statistics)
- **Interview:** 10 minutes (deeper)
- **Budget:** $70 (vs $130)
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks (vs 4)

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If 1 participant drops before Session 2:
- Recruit replacement OR
- Proceed with 1 (see main plan Section 12) OR
- Delay pilot to find replacement

### If major issues in P1 Session 2:
- **Fix immediately before P2!**
- Document what went wrong
- Test fix before P2's session

### If both participants struggle:
- **This is valuable data!**
- Means major redesign needed
- Better to learn now than with 20 participants

---

## 📈 Next Steps Decision Tree

### After 2-Participant Pilot:

**✅ System works well, insights gathered**
→ Consider recruiting 2 more (get full 2×2)
→ OR proceed to full study (16-20 participants)

**⚠️ System needs improvements**
→ Make fixes
→ Test with 2 more participants
→ Then decide on full study

**❌ Fundamental issues**
→ Major redesign needed
→ Thank participants for crucial feedback
→ Regroup and revise

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

1. **Treat as usability test, not research study**
   - Frame expectations appropriately
   - Focus on system improvement

2. **Maximize qualitative depth**
   - Longer interviews (10 min)
   - Think-aloud during session
   - Follow-up reflections

3. **Learn from the gap between participants**
   - Fix issues after P1
   - Test fixes with P2
   - Document improvements

4. **Be transparent about N=2**
   - In reports, acknowledge limitations
   - Don't overstate findings
   - Frame as exploratory

5. **Use findings to improve**
   - Goal = better system
   - Not: prove hypotheses
   - Every insight counts!

## ✨ Remember

**2 participants is enough to:**
- ✅ Validate technical functionality
- ✅ Gather usability feedback
- ✅ Test core parameter comparison
- ✅ Identify system improvements
- ✅ Assess readiness for scaling

**2 participants is NOT enough to:**
- ❌ Test statistical significance
- ❌ Conduct factorial analysis
- ❌ Generalize findings
- ❌ Make research claims

**Frame appropriately and you'll get great value!**

---

**Your role:** Observe closely, ask good questions, document thoroughly, improve the system.

**Good luck! 🚀**
