# Two-Session Pilot Testing Approach
## Summary of Changes

---

## 🔄 What Changed?

The pilot testing has been restructured from **one 60-minute session** into **two separate shorter sessions**:

### Original Approach (Single Session)
- ❌ One 60-minute session per participant
- All activities in one sitting
- Risk of participant fatigue
- Technical issues could derail entire session

### NEW Approach (Two Sessions)
- ✅ **Session 1**: 10 minutes - Login & Setup
- ✅ **Session 2**: 25 minutes - Poetry Writing & Testing
- Better separation of technical and creative tasks
- Participants familiar with system before main test
- Can fix login issues before actual data collection

## 📋 Two-Session Structure

### SESSION 1: Login & Setup (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Technical setup and baseline data collection

| Time | Activity | What Happens |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 0-3 min | Welcome & Consent | Sign forms, assign ID, explain two-session structure |
| 3-6 min | Questionnaire | Collect demographics and prior experience data |
| 6-9 min | Login Testing | Practice authentication, verify it works |
| 9-10 min | Schedule Session 2 | Book time for poetry session (1-7 days later) |

**Deliverables:**
- Signed consent form
- Completed questionnaire
- Verified working login
- Scheduled Session 2

---

### SESSION 2: Poetry Writing (25 minutes)

**Purpose:** Test the four room conditions and collect interaction data

| Time | Activity | What Happens |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 0-2 min | Welcome Back & Login | Participant logs in independently |
| 2-4 min | Platform Tutorial | Quick demo of chat interface and poetry forms |
| 4-19 min | **Poetry Writing** | Participant works with AI (YOU OBSERVE) |
| 19-24 min | Interview | Brief questions about experience |
| 24-25 min | Debrief & Thank You | Explain conditions, provide $25 incentive |

**Deliverables:**
- Conversation data (messages, timestamps)
- Poetry output

## 📝 Updated Session Protocols

### SESSION 1 Script (Login Test)

**Welcome:**
> "Welcome! This is the first of two short sessions. Today we'll just get you set up with the login system—should only take 10 minutes. In our second session, you'll actually create poetry with an AI partner. Sound good?"

**After questionnaire:**
> "Now let's test the login. You'll use your phone number to authenticate. Let's try that..."

**Scheduling:**
> "Perfect! You're all set up. Now let's schedule your poetry writing session. It will take about 25 minutes. When works best for you in the next few days?"

---

### SESSION 2 Script (Poetry Writing)

**Welcome Back:**
> "Welcome back [Name]! Ready to create some poetry? Let's log you in using the same method from last time."

**Tutorial (2 minutes):**
> "Quick overview: This is a chat interface. You'll choose a poetry form and create with your AI partner. **[Aware only: You'll see the AI's parameter settings here.]** I'll observe quietly. Any questions? You have about 15 minutes—let's dive in!"

**At 12-minute mark:**
> "You have about 3 minutes left if you'd like to wrap up what you're working on."

**Interview (5 minutes):**
1. "How was the experience?"
2. "What worked well? What was challenging?"
3. "Did the AI help or hinder your creativity?"
4. [Aware only] "Did the parameter info affect you?"
5. "Would you use this again?"

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do participants get paid after Session 1 or Session 2?**
A: After completing Session 2. This ensures they return for the main data collection.

**Q: What if someone doesn't come back for Session 2?**
A: That's why Session 1 is quick and low-commitment. If they don't return, recruit a replacement. You've only invested 10 minutes.

**Q: How far apart should the two sessions be?**
A: Ideally 1-7 days. Close enough that they remember the login, but flexible for scheduling.

**Q: Can I do both sessions in one day?**
A: Not recommended. The break helps participants come fresh to the creative task. But if absolutely necessary (tight timeline), separate by at least 2-3 hours.

**Q: What if login doesn't work in Session 1?**
A: Perfect! You've discovered the issue early. Fix it before Session 2. This is exactly why we separated them.

**Q: Is the 5-minute interview long enough?**
A: Yes! We've focused on 5 essential questions. Participants are more engaged with shorter sessions. You'll still get rich insights.
