## 6. DEBRIEF FOR P4 (Session 2: 24-25 min - FINAL PARTICIPANT!)

> **"Thank you so much for participating today! Let me explain a bit about the study design."**
>
> **"We have four different room configurations with different AI settings. You were in what we call the 'Exploratory-Unaware' condition."**
>
> **"Your AI partner was actually configured with higher 'temperature' settings, which makes it more creative and varied—more experimental and less predictable than other configurations. But you didn't see those technical settings displayed."**
>
> **"That's why the AI might have seemed more surprising or creative in its suggestions—it was intentionally set that way. Some other participants had AI partners configured to be more structured and methodical."**
>
> **"Some participants can see the AI's parameter settings, like temperature and style. You were in the condition where those details weren't visible. We're studying whether knowing about the AI's configuration affects the collaboration experience, and whether different AI styles work better for different people."**
>
> **"This helps us understand what makes for effective human-AI creative partnerships—whether people prefer structure or exploration, and whether transparency about AI configuration matters."**
>
> **"Please don't discuss the specific details with anyone else who might participate—we want each person's experience to be independent."**
>
> **"Would you like to receive a summary of the study findings when we complete the analysis?"**
>
> [If yes] → Collect email: _________________________
>
> **"Here's your $25 gift card. Thank you again for your time and creativity!"**
>
> [If receipt needed] → Obtain signature
>
> **"And congratulations—you were our final participant! Your contribution completes our pilot study. Thank you so much!"**

## 8. P4-SPECIFIC TROUBLESHOOTING

### If P4 asks about how AI works:

> **"The AI analyzes what you write and generates responses based on patterns it's learned. It's designed specifically to help with creative writing."**
>
> **[Keep it general—don't mention parameters]**
>
> **"What made you curious about that? Does it feel like it's understanding you?"**

### If P4 sees parameter display (CRITICAL ERROR):

- **WRONG ROOM LOADED**
- Check URL immediately
- Should be: `room_4_exploratory_unaware`
- If wrong, apologize: "Sorry, let me get you to the right workspace"
- Navigate to correct room
- Restart tutorial
- Document this deviation
- Note if P4 saw any parameter info

### If P4 wants more technical details:

> **"Great question! After the session during our debrief, I'll explain more about how the AI was configured. For now, just interact with it naturally and see how it feels. Your authentic experience is what's valuable for our research."**

### If P4 finds variety confusing:

- **This is valuable data** - don't intervene unless real distress
- In interview, probe deeply: "Tell me more about that confusion"
- Compare with P3's reaction to same AI style
- Key research question: Does awareness help with exploratory AI?

## COMPARISON NOTES (For Analysis Phase)

**P4 (Exploratory-Unaware) will be compared with:**

- **P3 (Exploratory-Aware)**: Same AI style, P3 sees settings
  - *Analysis question*: Does awareness affect experience with exploratory AI?
  - *Key metrics*: Confusion levels, trust, comfort with variety

- **P2 (Structured-Unaware)**: Both unaware, different AI styles
  - *Analysis question*: How do reactions differ to structure vs. exploration when unaware?
  - *Key metrics*: Preference indicators, satisfaction, creativity

- **P1 (Structured-Aware)**: Opposite condition
  - *Analysis question*: Maximum difference—what patterns emerge?
  - *Key metrics*: All dimensions

### Key Analysis Questions for P4:
1. Did P4 notice the exploratory nature without being told?
2. Was P4 confused or delighted by variety?
3. How did P4's trust compare to P3 (who knew about settings)?
4. Did P4 wish for more transparency?
5. Overall: Does awareness matter more for exploratory or structured AI?
