## 4. TUTORIAL SCRIPT FOR P3 (⚠️ AWARE CONDITION - EXPLORATORY)

> **"Great! Now let me show you how the platform works."**
>
> [Log P3 in using their phone number: ________________]
>
> [Navigate to: `room_3_exploratory_aware`]
>
> **"This is your workspace. It's like a chat interface. You'll have a conversation with your AI poetry partner."**
>
> **[Point to message area]**  
> **"This is where messages appear. You'll see what the AI says here."**
>
> **[Point to input box]**  
> **"You type your responses down here. Just like texting."**
>
> **[Point to send button]**

>
> ### ⚠️ CRITICAL FOR P3 - PARAMETER AWARENESS SECTION (EXPLORATORY)
>
> **[Point to parameter display section]**
>
> **"Now, you'll notice this section here shows some technical information about your AI partner."**
>
> **[Read what's visible on screen]**  
> **"It shows things like 'Temperature: 0.75' and 'Style: Exploratory.' This tells you how the AI is configured to work with you."**
>
> **"In your case, you have an 'Exploratory' AI partner with higher temperature settings. This means it will tend to be more creative and varied in its suggestions—more experimental and less predictable. It might surprise you with unexpected ideas!"**
>
> **"If you're curious about what these settings mean or how they affect the collaboration, feel free to ask the AI about it during your session. That's totally fine and actually interesting for our research."**
>
> **"Some people find this information helpful for understanding their AI partner, others ignore it. Either way is completely okay."**
>
> ### Back to General Instructions
>
> **"I'll be sitting nearby taking some notes for research purposes, but I won't interrupt you. This is your creative time with the AI."**
>
> **"If you encounter any technical problems—like the screen freezes or something doesn't work—let me know and I'll help. Otherwise, I'll just be observing quietly."**
>
> **"You'll have about 25 minutes to write. I'll let you know when we have about 5 minutes left."**
>
> **"Do you have any questions about how to use the platform?"**
>
> [Answer questions]
>
> **"Alright, the session timer is started. Take a deep breath, relax, and have fun creating! There's no pressure."**

## 8. P3-SPECIFIC TROUBLESHOOTING

### If P3 asks about parameter meanings:

> **"Great question! Temperature controls how creative and varied the AI's responses are. Higher numbers like yours (0.75) make it more experimental and unpredictable—it might surprise you with unexpected ideas. Lower numbers make it more focused and consistent."**
>
> **"'Top-P' is similar—it controls how diverse the word choices are. Your settings are configured for exploratory, creative collaboration."**
>
> **"Feel free to ask your AI partner about this during your session—it can explain too!"**

### If P3 can't see parameter display:

- **CRITICAL ERROR** - Wrong room loaded
- Immediately check URL
- Should be: `room_3_exploratory_aware`
- If wrong, apologize and navigate to correct room
- Restart tutorial
- Document this deviation

### If P3 seems confused by varied suggestions:

- **This is valuable data** - don't intervene unless they express real frustration
- In interview, probe: "Did the variety help or confuse you?"
- If they ask during session: "The AI is designed to be creative and varied. Try following some suggestions and see where they lead!"
- Let their authentic reaction emerge

### If P3 loves the exploratory style:

- **Great!** Document this enthusiasm
- In interview, probe why they liked it
- Compare later with P1/P2's reactions to structured style
- This is key data for understanding style preferences

  - *Analysis question*: How do reactions differ to structure vs. exploration when aware?
  - *Key metrics*: Creativity measures, satisfaction, preference

- **P4 (Exploratory-Unaware)**: Same AI style, P4 doesn't see settings
  - *Analysis question*: Does awareness affect experience with exploratory AI?
